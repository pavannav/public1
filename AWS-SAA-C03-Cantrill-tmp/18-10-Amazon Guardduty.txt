Welcome back and in this lesson I want to talk briefly about Amazon GuardDuty.
Now this is something which you only need detailed knowledge of for the security specialty stream of training.
Now I'll try to keep this lesson as efficient as possible so let's jump in and get started.
Now it's important at the outset that you know what GuardDuty is and what makes it special.
So it's a security service but specifically it's a continuous security monitoring service.
This means once enabled it's running all the time trying to protect your account and resources from any security issues.
Now the way that it works is that it can be integrated with supported data sources and I'll talk about this more on the next screen.
It's constantly reviewing those data sources for anything occurring within the account
and it also uses artificial intelligence and machine learning plus threat intelligent feeds.
Now the aim of the product is to identify any unexpected or unauthorized activity on the account.
GuardDuty is doing this in an intelligent way so you aren't having to identify things you usually do or define what normal activity is.
It attempts to learn this on its own and using threat intelligence feeds it tries to spot odd or worrying activity as it occurs on the account.
Now you can influence this so whitelisting IPs and influencing what it sees as OK behaviour
but the whole point of the product is that on the whole it learns patterns of what happens normally within any managed accounts.
Now if it finds something which logically is called a finding then it can be configured to notify somebody
or initiate an event driven process of protection and or remediation.
Now this might be a Lambda function performing some kind of remediation or an event driven workflow via CloudWatch events
but GuardDuty can be part of an automatic event driven security response and that's really cool.
What's even more awesome is that it actually supports multiple accounts via a master and member account architecture.
When you enable GuardDuty you're essentially making the account that you enable it in the master GuardDuty account
and then you can invite other AWS accounts and if they accept they become member GuardDuty accounts
meaning the product supports a single location for managing multiple AWS accounts.
Now architecturally the product looks like this.
First we have GuardDuty and GuardDuty receives logs from supported data sources.
At the time of creating this lesson this includes DNS logs from Route 53 showing DNS requests,
VPC flow logs showing traffic metadata for any traffic flowing through a VPC,
CloudTrail event logs showing any API calls within the account,
CloudTrail management events which cover any control plane level events
and then finally CloudTrail S3 data events which cover any interactions with objects within S3.
Now all of those are ingested together with various threat intelligent feeds
and are used to generate findings which show any unusual or unexpected behavior.
These findings can be sent to CloudWatch events now known as EventBridge
which can be used to handle event driven notification and automatic remediation.
So EventBridge can use SNS for notifications to any team members or external security management systems
or it can invoke Lambda functions which can interact with AWS APIs,
products and services to help automatically remediate any security issues,
maybe to add an explicit deny rule to a network ACL if there's a potential intrusion.
Now that's pretty much all you need to know for the exam and to get started using the product in the real world.
Now thanks for watching, go ahead and complete this lesson and then when you're ready
I'll look forward to you joining me in the next.
