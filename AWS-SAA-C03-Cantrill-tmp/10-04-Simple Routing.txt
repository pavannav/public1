Welcome back, and in this video I want to cover the first of a range of routing policies available within Route 53.
We're going to start with the default, and as the name suggests, it's the simplest.
This video is going to be pretty quick, so let's jump in and get started straight away.
Simple routing starts with a hosted zone. Let's assume it's a public hosted zone called animalsforlife.org.
With simple routing you can create one record per name. In this example, www, which is an A record type.
Each record using simple routing can have multiple values which are part of that same record.
When a client makes a request to resolve www and simple routing is used,
all of the values are returned in the same query in a random order.
The client chooses one of the values and then connects to that server based on the value, in this case 1.2.3.4.
Simple routing is simple, and you should use it when you want to route requests towards one single service.
In this example, a web server.
The limitation of simple routing is that it doesn't support health checks,
and I'll be covering what health checks are in the next video.
But just remember with simple routing there are no checks that the resource being pointed at by the record is actually operational.
And that's important to understand because all of the other routing types within Route 53
offer some form of health checking and routing intelligence based on those health checks.
Simple routing is the one type of routing policy which doesn't support health checks,
and so it is fairly limited, but it is simple to implement and manage.
So that's simple routing. Again, as the name suggests, it's simple.
It's not all that flexible, and it doesn't really offer any exciting features.
But don't worry, I'll be covering some advanced routing types over the coming videos.
For now, just go ahead and complete this video, and then when you're ready, I'll look forward to you joining me in the next.
