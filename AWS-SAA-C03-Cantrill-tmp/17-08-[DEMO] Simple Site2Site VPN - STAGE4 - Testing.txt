Welcome back to stage four of this mini project and in this stage, we're going to be doing what's shown on screen now
So we're going to connect to the on-premises server and then from there
We're going to access AWS server A to test the functionality of this site-to-site VPN connection
So let's go ahead and do that. So to do that, we need to move to the EC2 console
You should still have a tab open if you don't then you can open one in a new tab
Go to instances running and we're going to be connecting to the on-premises server and using that to connect
Through to the AWS server. Now, I want you to imagine at this point that this is just a normal Windows machine
On-premises you're sat at this desk and you're using it to connect through the VPN connection to the AWS environment
In reality, we're going to be using SSM to connect in to this server as it's a private only server
But just imagine you're sat at the desk and you're using it to connect into the AWS side infrastructure
So to connect to it go ahead and select on-prem server then right click go to connect
Select RDP client and we're going to connect to this instance using fleet manager
Which is a feature of SSM so that we can use the graphical user interface
So select connect using fleet manager and we need to get the password for this Windows instance
now to do that click on get password and you'll need to click on browse and select the
SSH key pair that you created and downloaded at the very start of this mini project
So go ahead and do that and then click on decrypt password
So it's going to give you the password at the bottom as well as the username
Copy the password into your clipboard make sure that you select fleet manager again
Because in my case it changed and then click on fleet manager remote desktop
We're going to be using user credentials, though
We could use key pair, but we'll stick to user credentials
so enter administrator under username and paste in the password that you've got in your clipboard and
Click on connect
This will take a few moments to connect
It's going to initially render a relatively small view
But if you click on the instance ID on this bar at the top
You'll get a full screen view now the quality is going to be relatively low
But this is only going to be used to illustrate the functionality of the VPN if you get this option about networks
Just click on yes now. We're going to do two things to verify the VPN functionality
We're going to ping the AWS server and we're going to browse to it
So you're going to need the IP address of the AWS server
So move back to the EC2 console go to instances running select AWS server a copy
It's private IP into your clipboard go back to the Windows desktop click on the Windows button
type CMD for command and
then click to open the command prompt and then type ping space and then the IP address of
AWS server a and press enter and you should see a ping response and
This ping is going over the site to site VPN
So this indicates the VPN connection is working fine as expected next we're going to verify the functionality of
AWS server a so open Internet Explorer then just click on ok
Maximize the screen to make it easy to see and then type
HTTP colon forward slash forward slash and then the IP address of
AWS server a and press enter and if everything's working as expected you should see a corporate themed web
application running within the
AWS environment and you can verify that by checking that this instance ID
Matches that of AWS server a so if we see it ends nine nine
D3 and there we go nine nine D3 so we can verify that this on-premises
Infrastructure is able to connect over the site to site VPN connection to the AWS environment and at this point
Congratulations, you've implemented the architecture that's shown on screen now
So this has been a relatively simple VPN demo you've created a site to site VPN connection between
AWS and the simulated
On-premises environment now the steps you would use to do this in production would be much the same
But you might have a different on-premises VPN or firewall which you need to configure
The architecture is still the same you'll be using multiple tunnels
And you'll be configuring routes and security groups and potentially network ACLs
Now I do have another advanced demo where I implement a much more complex
Dynamic BGP VPN and in this mini project you don't need to configure routing because BGP handles this
Automatically, but this has been a simple VPN mini project that's suitable for this level of study now at this point
That's everything that you need to do in this mini project aside from clear up the environment
You need to return your account into the same state it was at the start of this mini project
But that's what you're going to do in the next stage of this mini project at this point
That's everything you need to do in this video
So go ahead and complete the video and when you're ready
I'll look forward to you joining me in the next and final video of this mini project
