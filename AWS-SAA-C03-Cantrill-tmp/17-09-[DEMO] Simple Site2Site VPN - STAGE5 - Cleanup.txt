Welcome back, and in this final video of this mini project, we're just going to clear up the account
and make sure it's in the same state as it was at the start of this mini project.
So to do that, first we need to move to the VPC console
because we're going to have to manually delete the VPN configuration.
So to do that, scroll down on the menu on the left, go to Site to Site VPN Connections,
select the Site to Site VPN connection that you created, click on Actions,
delete the VPN connection, type Delete and then click Delete to confirm.
Next, go to the Virtual Private Gateway, select AWS VGW, go to Actions and Detach from VPC,
and then click on Detach Virtual Private Gateway, type Delete and then click Delete to confirm.
Next, go to Customer Gateways, select A4L On-Prem Router, click on Actions, delete Customer Gateway,
type Delete and then click Delete to confirm.
Once all of that's done, open a tab to CloudFormation, select S2S VPN,
which is the stack you created at the start of this mini project using the one-click deployment,
click on Delete and then Delete Stack, and that will return your account into the same state
as it was at the start of this mini project.
And at this point, that's everything you need to do in this mini project.
I hope it was enjoyable and you've learnt some really useful skills of how to create and configure a VPN.
At this point, that's everything that you needed to do in this mini project,
so go ahead and complete this video and when you're ready,
I'll look forward to you joining me in another exciting AWS mini project.
