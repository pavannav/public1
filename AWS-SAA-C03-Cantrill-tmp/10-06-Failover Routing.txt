Welcome back, and in this video I want to talk about the second Route 53 routing policy that I'm going to be covering in this series of videos, and that's Failover Routing.
Now let's just jump in and get started straight away.
With Failover Routing we start with a hosted zone, and inside this hosted zone a WWW record.
However, with Failover Routing we can add multiple records of the same name, a primary and a secondary.
Each of these records points at a resource, and a common example is an out-of-band failure architecture, where you have a primary application endpoint such as an EC2 instance, and a backup or failover resource using a different service such as an S3 bucket.
The key element of Failover Routing is the inclusion of a health check.
The health check generally occurs on the primary record.
If the primary record is healthy, then any queries to WWW in this case resolve to the value of the primary record, which is the EC2 instance running category in this example.
If the primary record fails its health check, then the secondary value of the same name is returned, in this case the S3 bucket.
The use case for Failover Routing is simple.
Use it when you need to configure Active Passive Failover, where you want to route traffic to a resource when that resource is healthy, or to a different resource when the original resource is failing its health check.
Now this is a fairly simple concept that you'll be experiencing yourself in a demo video, which is coming up very soon, but at this point that's everything that I wanted to cover in this video.
So go ahead, complete the video, and when you're ready, I'll look forward to you joining me in the next.
