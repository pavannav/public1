Welcome back and in this demo lesson, I just wanted to give you a bit of practical exposure to KMS and in this demo
We're going to continue using the scenario that we've got the cat ruler trying to send
Encrypted battle plans to the robot general now to get started
Just make sure that you're logged in to the I am admin user of the general AWS account
So the management account of the organization as always you'll need to have the Northern, Virginia
Region selected and once you do go ahead and move across to the KMS console
So click in the search box at the top type KMS and then open that in a new tab and then click on create key
Because we'll be creating a KMS key now KMS allows the creation of symmetric or asymmetric
Keys and just to keep this demonstration simple. We're going to demonstrate using a symmetric key
So make sure this option selected and then just to demonstrate some advanced options just to expand this and this is where you can
Set the key material origin if you recall from the previous lesson
I talked about how the physical backing key material could either be generated by KMS or
Imported and this is where you select between those two options
Now I'm not going to talk about the custom key store at this point in the course
I'll talk about this in more detail later on in the course when I talk about cloud
HSM which is a different product entirely for now
Just select KMS and this will make KMS generate this physical backing key material that we'll be using to do our cryptographic
operations
Now historically KMS was a single region service
Which means that keys created in the product could never leave the region that they were created in more recently
KMS has extended this functionality allowing you to create
Multi-region keys now for the purpose of this demo lesson
We're only going to be using a single region key, which is the default
So make sure that single region key is selected and then we can continue
So go ahead and click on next now in the previous lesson
I mentioned how a key has a unique ID but also that we could create an alias which references a key
And that's what we can do here
So I'm going to go ahead and create an alias and I'm going to call the alias cat robot all one word
So type in cat robot and click next now
I discussed earlier how a KMS key has a key policy and the key policy is a resource policy that applies to the key
Now it's here where we can specify the key
Administrators for a particular key there is a difference between
Identities that can manage a key and identities that can use a key for cryptographic
Operations like encrypt or decrypt. It's this point where we define who can manage this key
So go ahead and just check the box next to I am admin
So that will make sure that our I am admin user can administer this key. Once you've done that scroll down
There's a box here that allows
Administrators also to delete this key and that's the default so we'll leave that as is and click next
Now the previous step is where we defined who had admin permissions on the key
This stage lets us define who can use the key for cryptographic operations
So encrypt and decrypt to keep things simple. We're going to define it here, which adds the relevant entries to the key policy
So just check the box next to I am admin, which is the user that we logged in as and then just scroll down
We could also if we wanted to add other AWS accounts here so that they had permission to use this key
But for this demonstration, we don't need to do that
So just click on next and this is the key policy that this wizard has created
So if I just scroll down it assigns the account level trust at the top
So the account itself the account root user is allowed to perform any KMS colon actions on this key
So that is the part of the policy this statement here, which means that this key will trust this account
It's this statement that defines the key
So that I am admin inside this account can create and describe and enable and list and all of the other admin style permissions
For scroll down further still it's this statement that allows
I am admin to perform encryption and decryption and re-encrypt and generate data key and describe
Key actions against this key. So all of the permissions that were defined are inside the key policy
So at this point go ahead and click on finish and that will create the key as well as the alias that we'll use
To reference this key if we go into this key, I'll just show you some of the options that are available
We'll be able to obviously edit the key policy and we can define key rotation
So by default key rotation for a customer managed key is switched off and we can enable it to rotate the key
Once every year for an AWS managed key that is by default turned on and you can't switch it off
And it also performs the rotation approximately once every year
So if I just click on AWS managed keys as we go through the course and start turning on
Encryption for various different services. You'll notice how each service the first time it uses encryption with KMS
It creates an AWS managed key in this list now
That's everything we need to do on the AWS side now. We can start using this key to perform some cryptographic operations
So let's do that now at this point rather than using the local command line interface on your local machine
We're going to be using cloud shell and this allows us to use the same set of instructions
Regardless of your local operating system
So to launch cloud shell click on this icon and this will take a few minutes
But it will put you at a shell that's using your currently logged in user in order to gain permissions
So any commands you run in the shell will be run as your currently logged in user
So the first thing that we'll be doing is to create a plain text battle plan
So this is the message that the cat ruler is going to be sending to the robot general and to generate that file
We'll use echo and then a space and then a speech mark and then a small message and the message is going to be
Find all the doggos and then a comma
Distract them with the yums
so find all the doggos distract them with the yums and then a speech mark to close that off and
Then we'll redirect that to a file called battle plans dot txt and then press enter
Now the commands to interact with KMS from the command line are fairly long
So what I'll do is paste it in and then I'll step through it line by line and explain exactly what it's doing
So first we need to encrypt the plain text battle plans
And we want the result to be a cipher text document something that we can pass to the robot general
Which can't be intercepted en route and can be decrypted at the other end
So this is the command that we need to run and I just want to step through this line by line
The top part should be fairly obvious
So we're running the AWS command line tools the KMS module and using the encrypt action
So this specifies that we want to encrypt a piece of data
This line specifies the alias that we want to use to encrypt this piece of data
You can either specify the key ID which uniquely identifies a key or you can specify an alias
Using the alias forward slash and then the name of the alias in this case
I've elected to do that
So this is using the alias that we created in the first part of this demo lesson
This line is where we're providing the plain text to KMS and instead of typing the plain text on the command line
We're telling it to consult this file. So battle plans dot txt
Now the next line is telling the command line tools to output the result as text and it's going to be a text output
with a number of different fields
The next line double hyphen query is telling the command line tools to select one
Particular field and that's the field cipher text blob
And it's this field that contains the cipher text output from the KMS command
Now the output of any of these commands that interact with KMS is going to be a base
64 encoded file, so it's not going to be binary data
It's going to be base 64 encoded what we want to do is have our output being a binary
Encrypted file and so we need to take the result of this encryption command and pass it to a utility called base
64 and that utility using this command line option will decode that base 64 and place the result into a not
Underscore battle plans dot e NC file and this is going to be our resultant cipher text now
I know that command is relatively complex
KMS is not the easiest part of AWS to use from the command line
But I did want to step you through line by line, so you didn't know what each line achieved, okay?
So let's go ahead and run this command to do that
We need to click on paste and then once that's pasted into cloud shell press enter to run the command and the output
Not underscore battle plans will be our encrypted cipher text
So if I run a cat not underscore battle plans we get binary
Encrypted data so obviously anyone looking from the outside will just see scrambled data and won't understand what the message is
So now I'm going to clear the screen to make it a little bit easier to see and this is the encrypted cipher text file
That we could transfer across to the robot general
So now I want you to assume in this scenario that we're now the robot general and we're looking to decrypt this file
Okay, so now I'm going to paste the next command for this lesson
Which is the decrypt command and I'll be stepping through line by line just explaining exactly what each line accomplishes
So this is the command that's used to decrypt this cipher text and give us the original plain text battle plans
So first this top line should be logical. We're running the AWS command line tools with the KMS module and the decrypt command
We're passing in some cipher text
So we use the command line option double hyphen cipher text blob and instead of pasting this on the command line
We're giving it this file. So not underscore battle plans dot en C
We're again asking for the output to be in text. This will output some text with a number of different fields
We're using the query field to query for the plain text field and again the output will be base
64 encoded and so we're using the base
64 utility with the double hyphen D code to decode that back into its original form and store that
Into a file called decrypted plans dot txt
So let's go ahead and run this so click paste and then press enter to run this command
This will decrypt the cipher text and it will output decrypted plans dot txt and
If we cat that document
We'll see the original message find all the doggos
distract them with the yums and that's just been a really simple demonstration of
using the KMS encrypt command and the KMS decrypt command a
Couple of things that I want to draw your attention to throughout the process with the encrypt command
We needed to pass in the key to use as well as the plain text and we got out the cipher text
With the decrypt command we don't need to specify the key
We only give the cipher text and assuming we have permissions on the KMS key so that we can use it to perform decrypt
Operations then we'll get the decrypted plain text and that's what's happened here
Now just to clear up from this lesson if you go back to the AWS console
Make sure you're in US East one
So northern Virginia and go back to the key management service console
And we're just going to delete the KMS key that we created earlier in this lesson so click on customer managed keys
Select the KMS key that we created earlier in my case cat robot
Then click on key actions and schedule key deletion
You need to enter a waiting period between 7 and 30 days since you want this cleared up as fast as possible
Go and enter 7
tick the box to confirm and then schedule delete and
That'll put the key into a pending deletion state and after seven days
It'll be entirely removed and at that point we've cleared up all of the assets that we've used in this demo lesson
So go ahead and complete the video and when you're ready join me in the next
