# 7.5 Step-05- Test by connecting to MySQL Database

-: Welcome back.In this step we are going to create MySQL databasewith all above manifests, whatever we have created, right?So we are going to create itand then verify the storage class, PVC, PV, podsand then also list the pods.And then connect to our respective MySQL databaseand then see the schemas.Okay?So let's go ahead and then do that now.So we are in our respective folder,which is nothing but a 0402 SCP SV config map MySQL, okay?So Kubectl apply hyphen "f" cube manifest.So whatever the manifest is under thatit is going to create it.If any issues, it is going to throw the errorand then we are going to know about it.So we know that under the cluster IP service,we have a validation error.I didn't provide Cluster, C L U S E R.I didn't provide that "T" here. Okay?So let's go there and then fix that, okay?So cluster IP, right?So that's good.So now let's try one more time.So it should get created and the service also got created.So now if you see the,get PVC persistent volume claim.So now it is bound, you can see, right?So earlier it is in pending statewhenever we have directly created them.And then no, MySQL pod got created.So now we'll see PV,which is nothing but persistent volume got createdand then it's in use.Okay? It's bound.Okay? So this is the persistent volume, it got created.So now let's go back and then see the pods.Right?So our MySQL pod is running.Okay? So that's about it.So if you want to,find it with the respective label,means like app is equal to MySQLso you can do like this, okay?Hyphen "l" app is equal to MySQLEven you can list using MySQL pods.That's all, okay?So how to use labels, this is a just simple command.So now we'll move on to connect to this MySQLand then see what happens.Okay?So let's use the command Kubectl runand then use the interactive terminal ITand then delete this pod whenever it has been exited.And then we are going to use image, right?MySQL 5.6 for our client also, restart never.And then MySQL clientand then MySQL hyphen host is MySQL only.Why? Because whatever is running isa MySQL service only, right?And the password is DV password, 114 for our route password.Okay, so let's run this and then see what happens.Okay?So, right.So we should get the MySQL terminal, ideally.So let's see.It's taking a little bit of time.If you don't... Yeah, we got it, okay?So now if I say show schemas,so I should have,in addition to default schemas, user MGMT schema.So it got created.So whatever we have defined in our config map under data,the MySQL underscore user MGMT dot SQL got executedand it also created the user MGMT schema.So with this we have completedthe creation of our entire section,which is creating a storage class,creating a persistent volume claimand then using the dynamic provisioning.And we have created the config map.And then we have also created the deployment for MySQLand also the cluster IP service for MySQL, okay?So if you want to see, we can even see.So I can exit from this.So I'll say quit.And my container, my pod got terminated.Okay, MySQL client pod got terminated.So good.So if I say Kubectl get podsand I should have only one pod now, yeah.And then I should see SVC which is our cluster IP service.So that's good.Okay, so now this is about entire stuff.In our next lecture,we'll discuss little bit about the references section.And then we'll close this entire 0402 sectionAnd then we'll move on to user management service.So I'll see you in the next lecture.Until then, bye bye. Thank you.
