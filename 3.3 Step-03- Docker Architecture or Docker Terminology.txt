# 3.3 Step-03- Docker Architecture or Docker Terminology

-: Welcome back.So let's see the Docker architecture now.So or even we can call it as Docker terminology.So we have a Docker host and inside Docker hostprimarily we will install the Docker demo.So the Docker demo, Docker D reasonsfor the Docker API requests and manages Docker objectssuch as images, containers, networks, and then volumes.So the next is the Docker client.Okay, so Docker client is an optional thingin the Docker host.So we can either install on the Docker hostor on our own desktop and using the Docker clientwe will be able to communicate to the Docker demo.So Docker client can be presenton either Docker host or any other mission.So the Docker client, Docker is the primary waythat many Docker users interact with the Docker.So when you use commands such as Docker runthe client sends these commands to Docker Dwhich is nothing but Docker demo, which carries them out.So the Docker command uses the Docker APAso the Docker client can communicatewith more than one respect to demo.Okay, so moving on.The next thing is the Docker images.You can see here the image one and then image two.So, and image is a read-only templatewith instructions for creating a Docker container.So often an image is based on another imagewith some additional customizations.So example, like we may build an image which is basedon uber two image.So we already have a uber two imageand then consider that image we are takingand then building our own image using that uber two image.So with that uber two image,we install additional application optionsof what we are planning to usewhich is like Apache web servers or Java JDKand then additional tomcats, whatever we want to install.And then deploy our application inside that.And then package a test, our own application image.So the base image there we are using is that uber image.So that is called images based on another image.So moving on from Docker imagesthe next thing is the Docker containers.So a container is a runnable instance of an image.So we can create, start, stop, move,or delete a container using the Docker APARCLI.So we can connect the containerto one or more networks, attach storage to itor even create a new image based on its current state.So when a container is removed,any changes to its states that are not storedin persistent storage disappear.So that's most important point from container's perspective.So moving on.So let's see, we have a Docker hostand on Docker host we have the Docker demand.So if you want to pull the imageand then run it as a container.So what's the process going to be?Let's go ahead and then see that? No.So Docker client, it can be my desktopor even the Docker host.So what we do islike Docker client is nothing but the Docker demand.DLCK. Yeah, okay.So I'll say Docker pull, engineers demos/hello.So one sample image.So what happens is, it'll go and then communicateto the Docker demand, and then via Docker demandit'll go to the Docker registry, right?So from Docker registry,I'll try to pull the engineer's demo/helloand then download that image to my Docker host.So from my Docker host,so the image is present here.So now I'm going to run it, right?So to run it, I'm going to say Docker runand then some high fund port, local port,and then image port, whatever it is there.And then high fund, and then the complete image name.So whenever I do thatit is going to run it as a container in the Docker codes.So what we have doneso first we have pulled the image from the Docker registryand the store does images here, and then we have run it.And then now the runnable instanceof an image is called the containerwhich means like the container has startedand then application started serving.So now in this overall thingyou have seen client and then host, but you reallydon't know what is this registry or Docker hub, right?So let's see, what is this okay?So a Docker registry stores the Docker images.So Docker hub is a public registry that anyone can useand Docker is configured to lookfor images on Docker hub by default.So we can even run our own private registryin our cloud systems like Elastic Container Registryare using Docker hub.Also, you can even run it meanslike the Docker provide the software to run itas a private registry number local data centers.So when we use the Docker pullor Docker run commands that required images are pulledfrom our Configured, respect your registry, right?So when we use the Docker push commandour images push you back to the registry.So we are going to see two flowsby seeing what we have seen here, the complete thing.We are going to distribute into two flowsand then implement them in our upcoming lectures.So the flow one is two, what we have seen herelike pull our container image hereand then run it as a container, right?So the second flow is like build a image hererun it as a container locallyand then test it and finally push it to the Docker hub.So we are going to see all those things nowin a step by step manner.I'll see you in the next lecture.Until then, bye bye.Thank you.
