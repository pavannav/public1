# 4.10 Step-07- Kubernetes ReplicaSet - Introduction

-: Welcome back.In this lecture, we are going to understandabout one more Kubernetes concept, ReplicaSets.So, ReplicaSets help us in achieving high availabilityand then reliability for our applicationshosted on Kubernetes.In addition to that, it helps us to seamlesslyscale our applications.And, in combination with services and ReplicaSets,we'll also be able to achieve effectiveload balancing in Kubernetes.Finally, labels and selectors.So using labels and selectors,we'll be able to tie all the ReplicaSets,services, and then pods together.With that said, a ReplicaSet's purposeis to maintain a stable set of replica podsrunning at any given point of time.So, if our application crashes and any pod dies.Example if you see here, in a worker node,we have two pods and then one pod got died.So if that is the case,ReplicaSet will recreate the pod immediatelyto ensure the configured number of podsrunning at any given point of time.So we configure the number of replicas in our ReplicaSet.So if you say that always it need to have two replicas,then, ReplicaSet will ensure that it is runningwith two parts at any point of time.So, in this way, reliability and then high availabilityfor all applications are achieved.The next thing is load balancing.So to avoid overloading of traffic to single pod,we can use load balancing.So, Kubernetes provides pod load balancingout of the box using services for the pods,which are part of the ReplicaSets.So, labels and selectors are the key itemswhich ties all these things together.pods, ReplicaSets and services.So we will know in detail about these labels and selectorswhen we are writing the YAML manifestin our upcoming lectures.So if you considera Kubernetes cluster with two worker nodes,if you see the ReplicaSet is spanned across two worker nodesand we have two pods in one worker nodeand then two pods in another worker node.And mostly to access the applications hosted on these podsand then unload the effect to load balancing,so we will have the services in middle.So services will distribute the trafficto this respective ReplicaSetand the pods present inside that.So with that said, in combination with ReplicaSetand services, we can achieve effective load balancingin Kubernetes.And the next thing is scaling.So when load becomes too muchfor our number of existing pods,Kubernetes enables us to easily scale up our applications,adding additional pods as needed.So this is going to be seamless and super quick.So let's consider a Kubernetes cluster with two worker nodesand you have one pod in each one.And then a services load balancing the traffic to them.And all of a sudden, you have a spike in your traffic.If that is the case, to scale,you have multiple options in Kubernetes.First thing is go ahead and then update your ReplicaSets,number of replicas and decide number,how much you want, and then apply that.Or you can use kubectl scale to do that.Or you can even enable the HorizontalPodAutoscalerto auto scale the pods to achieveor to support the amount of traffic spikeat that point of time.Now, let's go ahead and then implementthe Kubernetes ReplicaSet demo.I'll see you in the next lecture.Until then, bye-bye.Thank you.
