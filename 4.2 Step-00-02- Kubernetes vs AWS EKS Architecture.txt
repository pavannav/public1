# 4.2 Step-00-02- Kubernetes vs AWS EKS Architecture

-: Welcome back.In this lecture we are going to understandabout EKS cluster architecturein combination with Kubernetes cluster components.Okay?So as usual in EKS control plane,which is nothing but cluster control plane,so you'll have the master node.Same as our regular Kubernetes cluster.So we'll have the container runtime,Kube APA server, headsets, Kube scheduler,and here it is going to be Kube control manager.And in addition to that, we are also goingto have something called Fargate control managerand then Fargate related scheduler also will be availableas part of that.So which we'll schedule the Fargate ports on,serverless Fargate, infrastructure in AWS.So in addition to that,if you see there we have the worker nodes.And here you can say it has EKS manager node groups.So under this we are going to anyway have worker nodes onlyand the container runtime kubeletand then Kube-proxy here common everywhere.So now what is differing here?Okay, so it means like you havethe EKS cluster control planeand the EKS manager node groupsand on regular on-premise Kubernetes alsowe have all of these things.It means like the master componentsand then worker components.So what happens in EKSs?EKS lets us focus only on our application workloads.So we don't need to worryabout any of these components.Either it is exit high availability,our kube scheduler part,our kube API server part,our disrespect to enter what is presentin these blue boxes is not our job.Our core focus will be how to design our applicationsand then how to deploy those applicationsinto Kubernetes clusterand its node groups available in AWS.So which means, so we really don't need to worryabout the high availability or the maintenanceor anything about these master worker nodes.So once we create and then create the cluster auto scalerfor our EKS, our job is done.So the rest end-to-end maintenanceof all of these componentswill be the responsibility of the AWS.So that's about the EKS specialty.So with that said, we'll moveon with our next steps in our upcoming lectures.So I'll see you in the next lecture.Until then, bye-bye.Thank you.
