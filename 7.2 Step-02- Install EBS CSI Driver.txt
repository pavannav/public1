# 7.2 Step-02- Install EBS CSI Driver

Welcome back.In this demo we are going to install the EBS CSI driver.And here for EBS CSI driver.Also we are going to use the pod identity.So we'll go to the clusters here x demo one.And we'll go to add ons here and click on Get more add ons.And in these add ons this is the one AWS, ebs CSI driver.So we'll select the CSI driver here and click on next.And for this CSI driver right.So add on access we are going to provide it using ECS pod identity.So using ECS pod identity.And in addition to that currently we don't have any IAM role created.So we'll click on this create recommended role.And this should open the IAM screen for us.Trusted entity type is AWS Service and Service.Our use case.Here you will select ECS and this role you are going to create for X pod identity thing.So this is ECS X pod identity and click on next and two policies already selected.When we click on next we are going to see them right here Amazon EBS, CSI Driver Policy and AmazonECS cluster policy.So trust policy is auto populated and two permissions which is CSI driver policy and ECS cluster policyboth got selected automatically.And we click on Create a Role.And we can see it here Amazon ECS Pod identity Amazon EBS, CSI driver role got created.So we'll go here.And it it got selected here automatically.If not you can refresh and select that role and click on next.And we'll leave all these things to defaults and click on create.So this should install the AWS ebs CSI driver for us.And this EBS csi driver is using the same concept what we have discussed in our previous demo, whichis nothing but AWS ECS pod identity.So it is using the same concept here.So let's uh, refresh to see that if a CSI driver installed and in the active status, it is in activestatus now.So we can go ahead and then verify whether equivalent pods are running in kube system namespace.So the command here is kubectl kubectl get pods and hyphen n kube system namespace.And you should see the ebs csi controller is running.And also csi node is running.CSI node is a daemon set which will be running on uh we can say cube ctl get ds and hyphen n kube system.Let's see that right.And we can see CSI node is running on two nodes and CSI node windows.Currently no nodes are available and we also have.This is a daemon set.CSI node is a daemon set.In addition to that we also have a deployment okay, which is uh CSI controller.So you can see EBS CSI controller also present, which means using Kubernetes.You will be able to create a, uh, EBS volumes on AWS, uh, using storage classes concept, whichwe are going to learn very soon in our next series of lectures.So how to access AWS services from Kubernetes Pods is nothing but x pod identity.And that we have successfully demonstrated in these two demos.Okay, now we have also successfully installed the EBS CSI controller, EBS CSI driver on our EKS cluster.So I'll see you in the next lecture.Until then, bye bye.Thank you.
