# 26.4 Step-04- Pre-requisites

-: Welcome back.In this lecturewe are going to work on the microservicesdistributed tracing prerequisites section.Okay. So we are going into 13 microservicesdistributed tracing using AWS X-Ray onEKS, okay.So, from introductory part,we remember that we discussed aboutunderstanding abouts AWS X-Ray services,understanding about Kubernetes DAM inserts,and then X-Ray and microservices network designwe have looked into,and also we have looked intosample soft service map tracesand then segments in AWS X-Ray.So the use case we are going to implement herewhich we also discussed in the segment sectionthat we are going to call a get notification app infofrom user management servicewhich will call the notification service notification X-ray.So which is nothing, but we are going to call a URLand then like this user management notification X-raywhich will call the notification app info service.So which we will also send our traces to our X-ray service.So we are also going to depict one microservicecalling other microservice in our X-ray service map.We have also seen that in our service map section.So the listof dock images we are going to use are withthe stack simplify slash cube user management microserviceand then notification microservice, which are highlightedwith 3 dot 00 , X-ray, my scale db, andthen 3 dot 0 dot 0 AWS X-ray refernotification microservice.So with that saidMyas LDBs mandatory when you use this service, right?So now the prerequisite section includes few things here.One is your RDS database should be up and running.So if it is down, so we have created thisas part of our 0, 6 section, right?So if it is not up and runningjust go ahead and then start that RDS service, okay?And whatever the database you are continuing from beginning.So that database, if it is stopped for any reasonjust go ahead and then start that.And the second thing is LB ingress controllerand then external DNS.So if we have seen architecture diagram, we are trying todepict everything, whatever is possible for usin AWS perspective.So we have, as part of this service, we are going tointroduce X-ray, but we have simple email servicewe have route 53, we have certificate managerin the EKS cluster, we have the RDS DBall this stuff for part of this entire architecture.So with that said, so application load balanceris also one section.Okay? So for that purpose application load balancerand then external DNS also you should be up and runningand then those should be installed on yourrespective EKS cluster.So every section we are adding this prerequisite stepbecause, so ourspecific templates will ensurethat you, it'll create a applicationingress service only meanslike application load balancer related ingress service only.It is going to create.So we need to ensurethat our LB ingress controller is runningand also our respective parts relatedto external DNS is runningbecause we are going to DNS resist and then tested.So external DNS is also running for me in my cluster.Okay? So with that saidso we have verified our LB ingress controllerand also we have verified our external DNS.So in our next step we'll focus on core X-ray demohow we need to run on our AWS EKS cluster.So I'll see you in the next lecture.Until then, bye bye.Thank you.
