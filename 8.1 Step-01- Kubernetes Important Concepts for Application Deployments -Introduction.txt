# 8.1 Step-01- Kubernetes Important Concepts for Application Deployments -Introduction

-: Welcome back.In this section we are going to learna few important Kubernetes conceptswhich are required for our application deploymentson the Kubernetes clusters.So in our previous lectures,we have implemented all these thingslike a MySQL deployment,where we have the MySQL database,and from that we have mounted the persistent storageof Elastic Block Store from AWS,with all these Kubernetes conceptslike storage classes,PersistentVolumeClaim,config maps, deployments,environmental variables, volumes, volume mounts,all these things, okay?So now what we are going to do is,we have completed the underlying part here,but we also need to focus on our applicationwe are deploying here.So first thing is, Secrets.So whatever the DB password,whatever we have provided for this application,why can't we send it in the encrypted format?So for that purpose we are going to use Secrets.The same we can apply for the MySQL root passwordenvironmental variable in deployment.So the next thing is, initialization containers.So these are nothing, but we have seen one issue related to,before the MySQL container started,the application got startedand then one more time it restarted,it didn't wait for the MySQL service to come up.So to ensure that MySQL container comes upand then starts the application,we can implement initialization containers.So in addition to that, we can implement livenessand then readiness probes of our application,so that the traffic can be allowed to this respective portonly once the livenessand then readiness probes are successful.So those we need to implement for our application.In addition to that,we can even implement requests and limitsfor our application ports.Which means how much CPU,how much memory in the Kubernetes clusterour respective application ports should be taking.We can request those thingsand then also put a hard limit for that using limits.In addition to that,if we have multiple versions of our applicationor if we want to deploy in the CME case clusteryou have staging and then developmentand then QA environments.So you can even create namespaces separatelyfor dev, QA, staging, and then deploy the same applicationand the same version inside those separate namespaces.So like this, you can use namespacesto differentiate your environments or in various reasonsor even for namespaces,like you can allocate for dev environment,my Kubernetes cluster.This much resources only should be allocatedfor this namespace, this much CPU,and then this much memory.So all those things we can implementand those are very important for the applicationswe are going to deploy on Kubernetes cluster.So these things we are going to implement.Now, so if you go here,in 05 Kubernetes,Important Concepts for Application Deployments.So we are going to look into Kubernetes Secrets,initialization containers,liveness and readiness probes,and requests and limits,and then namespaces in five sections now.I'll see you in the next lecture.Until then, bye bye.Thank you.
