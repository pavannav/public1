# 2.3 Step-03- Install kubectl CLI

-: Welcome back.In this lecture we are going to install the kubectl CLI.So, AWS provides the EKS vendor kubectl binary.So, if we are using the EKS clusters,it is always recommended to use the their own kubectl binaryso that we really don't run into many issues.So we can even download that directlyusing this reference link.So one important thing here we need to followis based on the cluster version, whatever you are using,here the binary will be availablefor 1.13, for 1.14, 1.15 and then 1.16.So we are going to use 1.16.So this link and in my documentation,whatever you see it is going to be same.But whenever you are going to execute using my video,please ensure that you go to this reference linkand based on the latest cluster versionyou are going to use.So from there you take the download link.Rest all commands you can execute as is.But for the download, the package link,always go to this documentation link.So now let's go ahead and then download this.So I'm just going to create a binary folder here.And I'm going to go inside thatand I'm going to download the package.So let's provide the exhibit permissions for the binary.And set the path by copying it to the home directory.So we'll create a bin folder in our home directoryand then we'll copy there and then set the path.And ones done, so let's verify that version.So we can see it here.V1.16.8-EKS means like the last Kubernetes service of AWS.So this respective kubectl binary is EKS vendor,AWS EKS vendor, binary which we are going to use.In our next lecture, we'll focus on installing the EKS CTL.Until then, bye bye.
