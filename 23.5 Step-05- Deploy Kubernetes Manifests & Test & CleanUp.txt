# 23.5 Step-05- Deploy Kubernetes Manifests & Test & CleanUp

-: Welcome back. In this lecture we are going todo the Kubernetes manifest deployments now.So let's go ahead and then deploy the stuffwhatever is presenting zero two cube manifest folder, right?So please ensure that you are in10 ECL elastic container restrain EKS directory and clear.And I'm going to say Cube CTL apply hyphen Fand then zero to cube manifest folder, right?So it's going to create our respect you deployment servicesand then ingress.So I'll say Cube CTL get paused, right?It is going to do in a default only.Okay, so my two cube ECR ports are running,right? So I'll sayget SVC. So it should create a equivalent note port service.That's good.And then I'm also going to say get ingress, right?So ingress you are also keen.So we can go back to our browserand management console and we'll go to E two, right?So it should be getting provisioned right now.So let me go to load balances.And our load balancer is getting provision applicationand it can verify the tag,it should be easier ingress service.And in listeners we'll have 40, 80 with the redirect.And this one certificate associatedand slash star should go to the respective target group.So let me open the target groupand it has the path as index start SGML whatever we providedat the note port service level and in targets.So it's getting registered.Okay? So let's wait for a while to get the thingsregistered. So I'll go to target groupsand then refresh one more time and then see.So it'll take a two to three minutes.So let's wait for that.In meantime we can go to route 53and verify our DNS here, right?So we should be ECR demo dot q1 cloud.com.So if you go here, so q1 cloud.com and insidethat you should find ECR demo dot q1 cloud.com.So this is also good.So let's go back, go back and go back to target groups.Refresh one more time and wait for it.So let's refresh and then check one more time.And these are healthy.That looks good.So one more check.What we need to do is N look up, right NS look upand easier demo dot Q1 cloud.com.So it's resolving and it same means like thisABDNS nameand this DNS name should have that same IPS right?So which is nothing but ingress DNS name.So 65 1 31 65, 1 31.This looks good.So now let's take this domain name and then goto the browser and then say new tab and thensay st tp colon slash slash ecr demo dot q1 cloud.com.So index start, TM alert isat the root context automatically.Ideally it should load, right?So now we can see that.Welcome to stack simplify AWS EKS Masterclass.Inside that integration with ecs, ECR registry is completed.And then we are able to access theURL in the browser directly.So this completes end to end demonstration of whatever EKSNESR.So now what we are going to do is we are going to cleanup the manifest whatever we have createdbecause we really don't want to bond our cashfor this respect to load balancer URL primarily.Okay, so I'm going to say Q ctl, delete hyphen Fand then zero two Q manifest.So whatever we have created, everything will get deleted.That's all, okay?So let's crosscheck everything got deleted or not.So if you go hereand then load balances and then refresh, it's gone.Okay? So that's about it.So I'll see you in the next lecture.Until then, bye bye.Thank you.
