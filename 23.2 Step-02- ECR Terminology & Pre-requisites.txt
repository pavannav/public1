# 23.2 Step-02- ECR Terminology & Pre-requisites

-: Welcome back.So as part of step one, we already understoodabout what we are going to do as part of this section.So in step two, which is nothingbut we are going to understand little bitabout the easier terminology.So which is nothing but what is registry repository?Repository, policy, authorization, token, and then image.So registry is nothingbut an easier registry is provided to each AWS account.So we can create image repositoriesin our registry so we can create multiple repositoriesin a registry provider to us.So, and then repository is nothing butan easier image repository contains our respectto docker imagesand repository policies.So we can control access to our repositoriesand the images within them with this repository policies.So, which means it is integrated with our AWS IAEM.And another thing is authorization token.So for Docker hub, if you want to login to docker hub to push your docker imageswe usually say Docker loginand then provide our username and then passwordin the same way for AWS ECR repositoryalso, right?If you want to log in, so from our Docker clientwe need to do the same, but the commands might hereand there differ.So, but the things will be same.So our Docker client must authenticateto Amazon easier registriesas an AWS userbefore it can push and pull images.The AWS CLA get login command provides aswith the authentication credentials to pass to the docker.So, and finally image, image is nothing, but wecan push it whatever the image we build locally, right?So that is the one we are going to push itto this repository, whatever we create inside the registryright? So there are some prerequisite things which arerequired before that, which is nothing but one isyou are AWS CLI V2 version ofthings should be configured on your local.So as part of zero one EKS create clusters using EKS CTLinside that with the installments, like the first sectioninstall CLIs.We have already installed AWS CLIand then configure that CLAwith our security credentialsof AWS with AWS configure.So which means we really don't need to worry about thisand install Docker CLA.So as part of Docker fundamental section here, okay?So in our respective course only you'll have somethingcalled zero two Docker Fundamental.So as part of this anyway, we are going toinstall the Docker desktop tooland if it is MacBook or Windows accordingly, right?So this is the Docker desktop already running.So you will do with the Docker sealinstallation you'll be doing as part of that.So if you are not completed the Docker fundamental sectionsearlier in this course or anything, don't worry about it.Just to help provided the direct links for Docker, for Macinstall, Docker for Windows install, and then Linux install.So you can go there and then steps will be pretty in detail.So very straightforward.So download it and then execute it.And then it should be running immediately, just the dragand drop on Mac and then it should be running immediately.So it's not a complicated one.Okay? So, and now on AWS consoleyou need to configure your CLI related tokenwhich we have done as part of this section.So which means the prerequisite sectionwhich we already completed as part of ourEKS create cluster sectionand then docker fundamental section.So with that said, we are directly movingon to our next step of creating the easier repository.So I'll see you in the next lecture.Until then, bye bye.Thank you.
