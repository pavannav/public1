# 5.1 Step-01- Introduction to Kubernetes Declarative Approach

-: Welcome back.So far,we have completed from Kubernetes Fundamentals Perspective.Using Imperative Way we have created a port.And for ReplicaSet we really don't have a imperative commandusing kubectl.So we use the yaml format to create it.And the deployment and servicealso using imperative way.We have created it.So now using yaml and then kubectlwe are going to create pods, ReplicaSets, deploymentsand then services in a declarative manner using yaml.So let's go ahead and then do that now.So I'll see you in the next lecture.Until then, bye bye.Thank you.
