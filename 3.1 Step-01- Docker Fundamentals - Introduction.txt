# 3.1 Step-01- Docker Fundamentals - Introduction

-: Welcome back.In this section we are going to primarily focus onDocker Fundamentals.So, what are the topics involvedin understanding the Docker Fundamentals?Let's go ahead and then see that now.So, we are in our github slash,github.com/stacksimplify git repository.So in that, there is one repository calledDocker-fundamentals.So if you go inside,we have a five sections involved in this understandingand then learning the Docker fundamentals, okay?So we are going to first understand what is Dockerand then in traditional approachwhat are the problems we are havingand then why, with the Docker how we are going to solve it.And we are going to understand the Docker terminologyor Docker architecture.So once all that is covered in first sectionthen we'll move on to the Docker installation.So in Docker installation,we'll focus on installation on Windows, Macand also troubleshooting Docker desktop issues on Mac.So from there on, we'll move on to two major flows,which are more essential for understanding the Docker.So the primary flow is like pull a Docker imagefrom Docker hub and then run the Docker imageas a container.So we have existing Docker images availablefor different applicationsand then how we need to pull thatand then run it on our local Docker machine.We are going to see it.In addition, the flow two is like build a new Docker imageand then run it locallyand then again push it back to the Docker hub.So how we are going to do that?So if we understand basic these two flows.So we are very good with the Dockerin the sense like we got the fundamentals thoroughly.In addition, we'll also focus on essential Docker commands.So the Docker architecture what we are seeingalready covered in Docker introduction.So we really don't need to worry about it, okay?But the core thing is we are also going to focus onessential Docker commands on day to day lifewhat we are going to use when we are using the Docker.So this is the core things we are going to perform now.So I'll see you in the next lecturewith the Docker introduction.Until then, bye bye.Thank you.
