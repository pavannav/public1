# 24.18 Step-18- [NEW] Clean-Up- Delete all resources which are not needed

Instructor: Welcome back.Clean-up is very, very important for this demobecause it is goingto create a application load balancer here, right?So which means it is goingto cost heavily if we don't clean-up,so we'll go ahead and then delete whatever we have created.So what we'll do is we'll go to terminal.We are in AWS EKS DevOps,and you have the Kube-manifests folder here.So we'll say kubectl delete -f, and then kube-manifests.So this should delete the deployment node port service,and also the externaldns related ingress service,whatever we have created.So let's wait for it to get cleaned up,and in the meantime, we can go hereand first delete the pipeline we have created.Even this is going to cost for us, okay?So delete pipeline, and I'll say Delete,and I'll delete the pipeline.And we have deleted the pipeline.Next is we have something called two CodeBuild projects,so you can delete these build projects.And in addition to that, you have created a SNS topic here.Okay, so if you go here,so we'll go here and delete thisSNS topic, delete me,and we have also created a subscription,so let's delete that subscription,and build projects, also you can delete it.It is not going to cost anything for build projects,but if you want, you can delete it, okay?I'm going to hold them for future reference,so I'm not going to delete them.And roles and policies also,it is not going to cost anything for us.We can leave them as is or we can delete them.And another important thing for my students isI need to make this GitHub repository public,so I'll try to do that in of itself, okay?So we'll go to Setting,not here, but here in the Settings,we'll try to make this GitHub repository publicso that everyone can access it.So I have also made this repository public,so you can go back here and try to access in incognito,and you can see we are able to access that repository.So that's about EKS DevOps demo.I'll see you in the next demo.Until then, bye-bye. Thank you.
