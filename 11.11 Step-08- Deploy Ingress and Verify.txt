# 11.11 Step-08- Deploy Ingress and Verify

Presenter: Welcome back.As part of step 06, we are going to reviewthe IngressClass Kubernetes manifest,which is present in 0801 load balancer controller install.And inside that, you have the Kube manifest folder.And inside that,you have the 01 IngressClass resource.yaml.So let's go to our visual studio code here,and go to 08 new ELB application load balances.And inside that 0801 load balancer controller install,and inside that you'll find something calledKube Manifest folder.And there you'll find the 01 IngressClass resource.yaml.And we already discussed about this in the presentationalso, API version, kind, metadata, and then spec.And here the API version is goingto be networking.k8s.io/v1, and kind is IngressClass,and name of my IngressClass is, My AWS IngressClass.And in Spec, you'll have something called Controller,and you'll define your controller name as,or you'll define the controller this with spec 2IngressClass you are going to tiewith is the AWS ALB Ingress controller,which is nothing but our AWS load balancer controller,you can save.And you also define the annotationingressclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "true"so that any Ingress services deployedinside this Kubernetes cluster will be associatedwith the AWS load balancer controllerwhatever you have installed in the previous steps.So that's another important thing to know.So now let's come back hereand deploy this Ingress resource.So we'll say Kubectl apply hyphen cube manifestso that anything presentinside this Kube manifest folder will be deployed.So let's come back to our terminal here.We are in 0801 load balancer controller installand we'll say Kubectl,apply hyphen F and cube manifest slash.And this should create the IngressClass for us.So let's wait for the IngressClass to get created.So we can see IngressClass got createdwith name My AWS IngressClass.So now we are going to get the IngressClassand also describe the IngressClass.So Kubectl, get IngressClass,and we should see that AWSmy AWS IngressClass got created successfully here.16 seconds before.And we'll also sayDescribe IngressClass.And its name is my AWS IngressClass.Kubectl describe IngressClass and my AWS IngressClass.And you can see name and annotationwhatever you have specified and controller, whatever it hasand events has nothing here.So this completes the creation of our installationof our setup of AWS load balancer controller on EKS clusterand also creating the IngressClass for and making itas the default IngressClass, a default Ingress controllerfor our Kubernetes using the IngressClass concept.So I'll see you in the next lectureor in the next section with Ingress basics.Until then, bye bye.Thank you.
