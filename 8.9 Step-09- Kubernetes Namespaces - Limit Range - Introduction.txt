# 8.9 Step-09- Kubernetes Namespaces - Limit Range - Introduction

-: Welcome back.In this lecture we are going to understandabout limit range concept in Kubernetesin relation with the name spaces.So, we are going to deploy our applicationsin the name spaces.And at that point of time,what is the use of this limit range conceptwe are going to see practically?So let's go back to our request and limit section,whatever we have implemented earlier.So in 0504, we have implemented request and limit sectionwherein if you go to our user managementmicroservice container, right?So in this deployment.So we have added the resources section here, right?And under resources you have saidthat these are the requests and then limitsand then my container can request for this CPUand then this much memory as a initial stateand then it can go up to this much limit.And then not above this limit it can use.So, my respective containerwhatever is going to be as part of this deployment.So this user management REST step containercan have the request says this muchand then limit says this much.So every time, if you want to add these things,you need to add these things in your means,like if you want to define your limitsand then requests related to your resourcesin your container means likefor your respect to application,then you need to update there respect to deploymentof that application if it is MySQL,or it is whatever, right?So in requests and limits,we didn't implement anything for this.So this doesn't have any limits here.This doesn't have any requests.But user management microservice, you have it.So every time you need to take this,nip out and then update in your MySQL deployment hereand then change whatever is our tuned parameters,whatever you want to use for MySQL,you need to define.But there are other options available as part of limitingwhich is nothing but the automatically appliedto these things.So let's see, what is that?A default option is available here.Let's see that, okay?So you have a name space thereand then you have both the backendand then front-end application.So front end, let's consider as whatever it is, Nginx,and then backend might be some otherREST services application, okay?So whatever it may be.So you'll have a limit rangeand then with limit range you'll be able to control your CPUand then memory.So in two ways.So one is default and the other is mean and then max.So you can assign it default CPUand then default memoryfor the container present in this deployment.And container present in this deploymentfor all the containers present in this dev name space.So which means whenever you apply that default optionof limit range, so you can have that default CPUand memory associated for those respective containerspresent in this name space.So whenever you say default,and then some CPU and some memory,you associate all the containers present in this name spaceare going to get that much things, okay?So, you really don't need to go aheadand then define this resources sectionin your respective deployment.So, we are going to see that nowby applying this practically.Same way it is for QA and then staging environment.So once you define your limit range herewith CPU and memory as default,so then automatically those default to CPU and memory valuesare going to get applied for the containers presentinside this namespace.I'm repeating again and againto get the super clarity on what we are doing.So here it is, okay?So limit range, manifest.As usual, API version kind metadata are going to be same,but you can see here we are going to associate this limitrange manifest means like we are goingto create this limit range manifestin the name space dev3.And under spec you'll have limitsand under limits you'll have defaultand then default request.So default is nothing but that default higher limit,how much it need to have,means like this respect to backend container,front-end container need to have.And then default request is nothing.But in our concept we havethe how much it is going to request initially, okay?So this this one, okay?So this default refers to limitsand the second default request refers to requests, okay?So now memory and then CPU.My limit I have given for our each containerin this respect to name space,in this respect to dev3 name space,for each container,maximum limit of each container is 512MB.And then CPU is 500M, which is nothing but 0.5 offone core CPU.And default request,which is nothing but how much initially it can requestis 256MB and CPU is around 300M.And to whom all these things need to be associatedper container type is equal to container,you can see it here.So, that's about the limit and rangeon a pictographic way are explaining it in a concept model.So now we'll go ahead and then manually implement it,write this manifest and then test itand then understand it better.So, I'll see you in the next lecture.Until then, bye bye.Thank you.
