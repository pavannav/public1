# 27.2 Step-02- Pre-requisites Check

-: Welcome back.In step two, we are going to look intoprerequisites required for our this section implementation.So as usual,we need to have the AWS database up and running.So because we are using the My Skill External Serviceand then we are referencing the same thingin our user management deployment service.So next thing is we also need to ensurethat we have our ALB ingress controllerand then external DNS port up and runningbecause we are going to usethe ALB ingress related manifest hereand also leverage the external DNSfor registering the cany demo dot qan cloud.com in Route 53.And in addition to that,we also need to ensure that Xray demos up and running.So for the fact that we are going toleverage all the Xray related ports herewhich means Xray related demo set is deployedand then it should be up and running.Those things we need to ensure those are running.So let's crosscheck our ingress is up and running.So in every section this is a common prerequisite step,but if it is not mentioned,then by any chance we have issues.So then this prerequisite step is the core thingthat these need to be requiredfor those templates, whatever built.So LB ingress controller, it should be up and running.And in default name space, we should have external DNSand then X-Ray Damon.So both should be up and running.So external DNS is up and running.And then Xray demos are up and running. Good.So this confirms that our prerequisites are goodand if you want, you can go back to your RDS databaseand then crosscheck.And for RDS, you have an option to also use alternatewhich is nothing.But instead of using RDS databaseif you want to use in memory databasejust change this to 4.0.0 xray H two db.So the CME is also shown in ara hub dot docadot com earlier also.So the same thing you can usefor RDS database if you want to use that.But always try to ensure that we are usingMy Skill type of stuff so that weit means like when we are learningor when we are planning to learn also,we are leaning towards more real-time examplesinstead of some in memory stuff.But for backup also, I have provided this image for youand it is also going to workwith all these use cases without any issues.Only thing is data is not going to persistif try to create user and then list users, all those things.That's about it.So in our next lecture,we'll focus on reviewing the manifest.So I'll see you in the next lecture.Until then, bye bye.Thank you.
