# 4.14 Step-11- Kubernetes Deployment - Demo

-: Welcome back.In this lecture we are going to do the deployment demo.So we'll go to zero four deployments with kubectl.So let me go insideandinside that 0 4 0 1 will be creating our deploymentscaling our deployment, and exposing it as a service.So all those things, we are going to do it now, right?So step zero one, introduction to deployments.We have just now completed.So we are going to move on to creating a deployment, right?So to create a deployment we are going to use kubectl.Create deployment and the deployment name,whatever we are going to put and our container image.So we are going to use the kube Nginx image.And if you see here,this is the docker image locationand we have 1.0024.00So if we have four versions of our Nginx applicationwhich we are going to leverageand then test end to end all the deployment feature support,updating the deployment, rolling back the deploymentor pausing and then resuming the deployment.In addition to that,rolling back the deployment to specific versionor rolling back the deployment to older versionor previous version.All these things we are going to test it.So that's the reason we have four versionsof our engines application present here.So let's go back.So let's create the deployment now.So we are going to copy thisand go hereand paste it.So our deployment got created.So we'll say kubectl get deployment.Right?So our first deployment got deployed evenwe can use the alias name deploy.So these aliases will help us in when we are in hurry.We really don't need to completely provide the deploymentsor just give deployand then it provides the output.In the same way for services it is SVand then for parts people.So it's always good to learn this earlier access.For ReplicaSet, it is going to be RS.So like that.So now,kubectldescribedeploymentand the deployment name.So my firstdeployment,right?So this is the deployment scaled up ReplicaSet bymy first deployment,whatever the ReplicaSet name it is providing.So if you say kubectl, get RS.So we have seen that creating a deploymentwill create the ReplicaSet.So it has created one.So we can see it.And it has one pod under it.So let me clear this and saykubectlget pod.So we have one pod created as part of this deployment.So now the next thing is to scale our deployment.So using kubectl scale,we'll be able to scale our deployment.So let's do that now.Kubectl scaleand the number of replicas, I want it from1 to20,right?And my deployment name,right?My firstdeployment.So you can use deployment space.My first deploymentor even we can use this, anything is fine.So now it is going to scale.So let's see, kubectlgetdeployand alsokubectlget.So we have 20 and then already 16 is available.Now they are coming up.So one more time if we check.So mostly 20 should be available.So you can even say kubectl get podand you see all 20 out of 20 are running.So one more thing here is kubectlgetReplicaSet.And if you seeinReplicaSet.So we got the output data.20 out of 20 are happening, running, all the pods.So now the next thing islike we can scale down our deployment using replicas to 10.So let's go back here and our instead of 20let's bring down our thingsto10and automatically,ourpods will get terminated now,right?So out of 20, 10 pods will get terminated and thenwe will end up with only10 pods.That's good.So now the next thing is expose deployment as a service.Again, we are going to use the same node podservice concept.What we have used it for our pod earlier.The same we are going to use it.So instead of deploy- for pod,we are going to use it as deployment.Kubectl expose deployment and deployment name.And the type is going to be node podand my service pod is going to be 80 and the target podmy container pod is going to be 80 and the nameof the services my first deployment service.So let's go ahead and then create this now, right?So let the service get created and now kubectl,getSVC.And my services got created and this pod,node pod is 3 2 1 6 9.So I'll say kubectl,get nodes,hyphen oand then wide.So now I got the public IP.So I can use any one of them out of two and then 32169.So let's go ahead and then access itnow,right?So 3, 2, 1, 6, 9.So now our application V1 version is up and runningand then we are able to access it means like a deploymentexposed as service for us,right?So let me go back here.And that completes thesimple creation of a deploymentand then testing of scaling the deploymentand also exposing the deployment as a service.So everything we have done usingimperative commands using kubectl, right?So in our next lecture,we'll focus on updating the deployment.So until then, bye bye.Thank you.
