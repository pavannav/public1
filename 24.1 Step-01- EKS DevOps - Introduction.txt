# 24.1 Step-01- EKS DevOps - Introduction

-: Welcome back.In this lecture we are going to understandabout core DevOps concepts like continuous integrationand then continuous delivery or deployment on a high level.So to achieve this DevOpsin AWS on EKS.So we can use a few tools like CodeCommit, CodeBuild,and then CodePipelining AWS.So using these thingswe are going to implement continuous integrationand then continuous delivery.So let's see the stages in release process now.So we have source sourced it.So in source stage we are going toif you take any application, so we need to checkin the source code to our Watson control repository.And then we can even send those things for peer review.Those checked in code.And in addition to thatwe can also provide pull request process implementation.So that's about the source stage we do it.In build stage.So we are going to compile the codeand build artifacts like WAR file, JAR files,container images or even Kubernetes manifest files.And then unit test them and then move onto the test phase.So we will do the integration testing with other systemsin test phase and load testing, UI testing,security testing, and then test environments, del Q,and then staging environments.So all come under this test phaseand then we'll have something called production phase.So deploy to production environments and then monitor codein production to quickly detect the errors.So now let's see which stage belongs to which type here.Okay, so which means like source and build stages comesunder the keyboard, most running keyboardin the industry now, which is continuous integration.And the next test and production phasescome under continuous delivery or continuous deployment.So one more thing here is infrastructure as code.If you see continuous integration,continuous delivery, continuous deployment.So all these are big, big buzzwordsin the industry nowadays.Okay, so now how these are relatedto our regular release processis what this slide outlines.Okay, so and now let's see infrastructure as code.So whatever we havein source, build, and then test productions.So all of these stagesif you want to automate using AWS CloudFormation.So you can automate thatand then just check in the templates.And then at all these source stage, build stage, test stage,and then production stage, all things relatedto their infrastructure also can be writtenin code and then available for us.So that's about the infrastructure as code.And next thing is continuous integration, right?So in continuous integrationwhat does this mean on a high level?So automatically kick off a new releasewhen new code is checked in.So that's one thing.And build and test that codein a consistent, repeatable environment,and continually have an artifact ready for deployment.So that's the continuous integration.So let's also see what is continuous delivery, okay?So in continuous delivery or deployment,automatically deploying new changesto staging environments for testing.So deploy to production safelywithout affecting the customersand deliver to customers fasterand increase deployment frequencyand reduce change lead time and then change failure rate.So these are the advantagesof continuous delivery process if we implement it.So now how this AWS developer toolsor code services you can call,how this fit into this continuous integrationand continuous delivery pipelines, okay?So AWS has something called CodePipelinewhich will be in integration with the different AWS tools.So example for source it is goingto use the AWS CodeCommit,which is something like a GitHub repository.So here we call it as CodeCommit repositoryand for building.So we usually see Jenkinswe might have seen in many placesbut in AWS we can use CodeBuildand which is a tool which provides usto build our artifactsand then push you to S3 buckets in AWS.And next is testing.Okay?So either you can use CodeBuild plus third-party toolsto do our testing-related things, okay?And next is deploy.So in our case for Kuberneteswe are using CodeBuild in combinationwith Kubectl to do that deployment in our use case.So I brought them under the deploy stage here.Okay, and next is monitoring, okay?So from monitoring perspective you'll havesomething called CloudWatch Container Insights.So using that, we are going to dothe end-to-end monitorof our container applications deployed on Kubernetes clusterand also Kubernetes cluster-related components.And then Kubernetes cluster-related resourcesalso will be monitored using CloudWatch container insights.And we have a dedicated sectionfor CloudWatch container insights.And then you can learn more and more about that there.Okay?And next thing ishow these tools will be fit in under which category.So we are going to see that in this slide.So continuous integration comes under CodeCommit,CodeBuild source.So in source and build stages we have CodeCommitand then CodeBuild.So we can map themto continuous integration and CodeBuildwith Kubectl plus CloudWatch container insightsyou can put them underthe continuous delivery or deployment section, okay?So that's about on a very high level introductionabout AWS code servicesand then how we are goingto achieve DevOps use cases using these things, okay?So we'll start the hands-on activity from our next lecture.So I'll see you in the next lecture.Until then, bye-bye.Thank you.
