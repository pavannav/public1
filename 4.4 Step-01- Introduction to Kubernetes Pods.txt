# 4.4 Step-01- Introduction to Kubernetes Pods

-: Welcome back.In this lecture, we are going to understand aboutthe core Kubernetes concept named Pod.So, with Kubernetes, our core goal will be to deployour applications which are in the form of containerson the Kubernetes worker nodes in Kubernetes cluster.Kubernetes does not deploy these containers directlyon the worker nodes.Container is encapsulatedinto a Kubernetes object named Pod.So a Pod is a single instance, often application.So a Pod is the smallest objectthat we can create in Kubernetes.Pods generally have one-to-one relationshipwith containers.So, if you see here, we have one Pod in worker node oneAnd then we are having some amountof traffic coming to that.If our traffic keeps growing,we are going to add new Podsfor scaling our application, like this.So that it means is to scale up,we create new Podsand then to scale down, we delete the Pods.So for our application, if the traffic keeps growing,we need to scale our application in the form of Pod.So now, we cannot have multiple containersof same kind in a single Pods.So this is one more important thingwhich we need to understand.So if you have a worker node one,and then you have a Pod with Nginxserving the purpose of static contentor it is acting as a proxy.So now if your traffic keeps growing here,you cannot scale your container image inside the Pod.Always, whenever your traffic is growing,you need to scale the Podsinstead of scaling the containers inside the Pods.This is the wrong way, and this is the right way.So two Nginx containers in a single Podsserving same purposes, not recommended all in all.So now, if you see,we can also discuss about multi-container Pods.So can we have multi-container Pods?Can we have multiple containers in a single Pods?Yes, but in exceptional cases.Out of 100, 99% always one Pod will have one container.And the one person cases are,we can see now in our next slide.So we can have multiple containersin a single Pod provided they are not of same kind.Example. In this Kubernetes cluster,in this worker node, you have a Podand you have Nginx container serving the static contentor acting as a proxy.And you have one more Nginx containeror whatever the containerwhich is called the helper container.So they do the helper jobs here.So what are these helper containers?In Kubernetes stumps, we call that as sidecar containers.So we can call them as data pullers,data pushers or proxies.So as data pullers, they pull data requiredby the main container from some other servicein the network.Or they push the data by collecting the informationfrom this Nginx main container.Or they can even act as proxies.Means like right static data to HTML filesusing helper container and reusing main containers.Or moreover, if you go into morelike our cloud technologies, usually,the latest is like now you know the Istio,and all these things came in.So we will always have a sidecar containerwhich is nothing but the envoy proxy.So in such cases, we use the sidecar container.But all in all, 99% cases,always Pod to container is a one-to-one relationship.So now, when we are using these multi-container Pods,we have the following advantage,the two containers can easily communicatewith each other as they share the same network.And they can also share the same storage space.So multi-container Pods is a rare use caseand we will try to focus on core fundamentals,which is nothing but one Pod to one container,one-to-one relationship.Now, in the next lecture, we are going to focuson the Kubernetes Pods demo.So I'll see you in the next lecture.Until then, bye-bye.Thank you.
