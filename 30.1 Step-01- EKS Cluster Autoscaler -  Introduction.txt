# 30.1 Step-01- EKS Cluster Autoscaler -  Introduction

-: Welcome back.In this lecture we are looking intoCluster Autoscaler from EKS.So how we are going to do that,cluster node groups autoscaling means like inside the groupshow we are going to autoscale the EC2 worker nodes.So on a very high level Cluster Autoscaler is a toolthat automatically adjust the size of a Kubernetes clusterwhen one of the following conditions is true.So there are parts that fail to run in the clusterdue to insufficient resources.During that time so Cluster Autoscalerwill increase the number of nodes so that these partsgets the sufficient resources to schedule on the new nodes.And there are nodes in the Clusterthat have been underutilized for an extended period of timeand there parts can be placed on other existing nodesand then these underutilized nodes can be removedfrom the Cluster and then get terminated.So from cost point of view, Cluster Autoscalerhelps a lot for us in increasing or decreasing.So from performance point of view,for increasing the number of nodes,for scaling up the number of nodes, it helps us.And from cost perspective,it saves us when we are not using the resourcesit can scale down and then help us from cost perspective.And the Cluster Autoscaler modifies our worker node groupsso that they scale out when we need more resourcesand then scale in when we have underutilized resources.All in all, it is going to benefit us a lot.So let's go to our GitHub repo and, if you see here,17 EKS Autoscaling Cluster Autoscalerwill be our current section.As part of that, we completed the introductory sectionand then in our next lecture we'll focus on our step two.So I'll see you in the next lecture.Until then, bye bye.Thank you.
