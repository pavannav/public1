# 8.7 Step-07- Kubernetes Namespaces - Introduction

-: Welcome back.So in this lecture,we are going to understand about Kubernetes namespaceson a very high level.So name spaces are also called virtual clustersin our physical Kubernetes cluster.Why?Because we create a Kubernetes objectsinside these namespaces which will be isolatedfrom other objects outside of this namespace.So that's the reason we call it as a virtual cluster.So usually these name spaces are used in environmentswhere we have many users spreadacross multiple teams or projects.So we have many projects and then many teamswhich are accessing all these projectsdeployed on the Kubernetes cluster.And if you want the complete isolation boundaries definedfor these each teams of the end environments,then we can use the namespaces.For simple clusters with the minimum number of usersor minimum number of applications,which we really don't feel as complex,we can directly don't need to use namespaces.But personally what I recommendis this is what document recommends,but personally what I recommend based on my experiences,start using namespaces.If respect you have if you use the resource quotaand then other advanced options,at least if you start using the namespacesand then pushing your objectsto that respective isolated boundary,excluding the resource quota concepts,so what happens here is likeyou'll get a lot of advantageswhen you are doing,when you are getting to experience those things,you'll understand better.But my personal recommendationis start using namespaceseven in these tens of users of in this areaalso start using namespaces.It's no harm in having your objectsdedicated in a namespaceinstead of having them in a default namespace.I respect you if you don't use this namespace concept also,whatever you are creatingis going to go into it a default namespace.So if that is the case, what is wrong in using namespaces?So, that's my recommendation.So, moving on.So, what are the benefits we are going to get?So, when we create these namespacesit creates the isolation boundaryfrom other created objects,further objects whatever we have createdinside that namespace.So we are going to see all those things in our next slide.We can also limit the resources like CPU and memoryon per namespace basisusing the resource quota option available in Kubernetes.So you can create a namespaceand provide that resource quotalike it need to use only two CPU codesand then 4GB of memory, so you can do that.So that's the reasonyou can even call it as a virtual cluster.So, now moving on.So how to get the namespaces?So you can say kubectl, get namespaceand then you'll get the by defaultto whatever has created as part of the cluster creation.So Kubernetes cluster creation,all those default namespaces will be available.So let's start with what is this default namespace.So let's understand this default namespace is nothing.But so far whatever we have donein our continuous previous lectures,whatever we have done so far, whatever we deployed,all objects were deployed under this default namespace.Our user management application,or our Nginx application, whatever we have doneall those are getting under this default namespace.That's the reason, whatever I sayis like whatever we create anywheregoing into one default namespace.Instead of that, if you want to clearlyand then clarity manage your objects in Kubernetes,start trying to use namespaces.And next thing is kube node release, okay?So this namespace is for the lease objectsassociated with each node,which improves performance of our node heartbeatsas the cluster keeps scaling.Okay?So using the auto scaling when the cluster is scaling.So this, using this kube node release,we are going to have the better performance of our cluster.Okay?But the core thing is we really don't needto worry about that or we really need toor look into that one.So, one more will be there, which is kube public.So this namespace is created automaticallyand is readable by all users, even the unauthenticated usersof my Kubernetes cluster.So this name space is mostly reserved for cluster usagein case that some resources should be visibleand readable publicly throughout the whole cluster.So kube node release and kube public,we really don't need to worry about these things, okay?So one thing which is default,where we create by defaultwhenever no namespace is mentionedit is going to go into default.And another thing which we have is kube system.So this is what we should be aware of.So all the Kubernetes system-related objectswill be created in the kube system.So let's go ahead and then see that now.So, let's see what I'll presentin our kube system namespace, okay?So I'll say kubectl, okay?So get all objects and then hyphen, hypen,namespace kube-system, right?So it'll provide all the objectspresent in our system, okay?So you can see it here.So, the following parts are presentand then you also have a service named kube DNS,which is a cluster IP.And you also haves AWS node two partsand then code DNS two partsand then EBS CSI controller,which is elastic block toward CSA controller two ports.And the CSI node which is a DaemonSetrunning on each of our cluster nodes.Two cluster easy two instances we have.And on them they're running.And we also have kube proxy.So you can sees AWS node is a DaemonSetand EBS CSI note is a DaemonSetand Kube proxy's a DaemonSet here, okay?And in addition to that you have core DNSand then EBS CSI controller deployment createdand you also equal and replicate cellsalso you can see here.So kube system is nothing but all the system objectsare running here inside the kube system namespace.So let's understand little bit, okay?So kubectl, get namespaces, you can say NS.NS is the alias for name spaces here, okay?And in addition to that,one thing we have done just now is kubectl,get all, right?So and then hyphen, hyphen namespace we have given.You can even view hyphen N and then kube systemand the output should be same, right?So, get to all objects from the kube system using hyphen N.So that's about it, okay?so now let's come backand we'll move on to the next slide.So here what we are going to understandis a pictorial representation of our namespaces.So if you see I have a simple applicationwith a simple backend application.So maybe my REST service applicationwhich we have seen in in our previous examplesand then which is front-end with the Nginx proxy, right?So now whatever my backend application,whatever I do the deployment,when it creates a replica and it's equivalent port.At the same time, to access that inside the clusterwe create a cluster IP service.And once for the front-end service,you create the deployment and automaticallythe replica second port created.And if you want to access via internet,you can use node port serviceor the load balancer service, okay?So now all these objects are packed under it.Namespace name, dev.So which means, whenever you create these objectsyou can direct themto create it directly on the namespace dev.In the same way, if I want to create QA,again the same objects can be created in QA.So now if you see by defaultif these gets created in default namespacewith the same names, they cannot get createdin the same default namespace one more time.But now our namespaces are different.If for example, this deployment name is backend one, okay?So now it is in dev it gets createdand in QA it gets created.In other environments it gets created.How it can get createdis because of it is completely a isolation boundaryfor all these objects using this namespaces.Now, let's see the namespace manifestin a declarative manner.So as usual, our standard template is API version kind,metadata name and then spec.So namespace doesn't have any other additional information.We really don't need to have any spec there.So you'll have API version is V1,kind is namespace and metadata inside that name,I'm giving my namespace name as dev3 here, okay?And if you want to do it in imperative way,again it is going to be very, very simplewhich is kubectl, create namespace, dev1, that's all.So this is a very high level introductionabout the namespaces.So, in our next lecture we'll go aheadand then create applications in dev1, dev2 namespaces,and then understand it better.And then get our hands on with these namespaces.So I'll see you in the next lecture.Until then, bye bye.Thank you.
