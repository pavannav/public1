# 4.9 Step-06- Delete Pod

-: Welcome back.In this step,whatever the objects we have created,we are going to delete them.So using kubectl delete, we can delete them.And using kubectl get all,we can get all the objectspresent in the default namespace, right?So I'll saykubectlget all.So which will provide all the objects presentin the default namespace.So which is nothing,but I have my part, my first part.And I also have the service my first service,my first service two,and then my first service three, right?So now let's go ahead and then delete one after the other.Kubectldeleteand then podand then pod name ismy first pod.So I can type itand mypod got deleted.In the same way,we can go ahead and then deleteservices, svc,andmy first service,and two,and then three.So now if you say kubectl get all,you'll only see plus try p service of Kubernetes.Rest all got deleted.So that's about the cleanup.So I'll see you in the next lecture with the ReplicaSets.Until then, bye bye.Thank you.
