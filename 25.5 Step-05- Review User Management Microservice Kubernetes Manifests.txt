# 25.5 Step-05- Review User Management Microservice Kubernetes Manifests

Instructor: Welcome back.In previous lecture we have reviewed all theKubernetes manifest related to notificationcluster IP service, notification relatedexternal name service,and then notification microservice deployment manifest.So now we are going to look intouser management microservice which is UMS note port service,UMS deployment, UMS my skill, external name serviceand then UMS ingress service.So let's go ahead and then review them now.So if you go to our GitHub repo, so the step seven herewhatever it outlines is like update user managementmicroservice deployment, manifest with notification serviceand we on mental variables.So if you see in this architecture diagram, so UMS serviceneed to call them notification service.So how it is going to callit'll call the notification cluster IP serviceand then cluster IP service will call it soonnotification respect to port, right?So now let's go backand then review that in our visual studio code.So user management microservice.So if you see its environmental variables, this isthe same user management microservice deployment templatewhatever we have been using from EBS block storeand then RDS databases or network load balancesapplication ,load balancers, Fargate, everywhere.Okay? So that's the reason we are not going in detail.What is kind and then what is specwhat is selector, what is spot template here?Okay, so we are directly gettinginto the environmental variablesand in environmental variables.So these are the standard ones which are relatedto RDS database, which we have discussed in our RDS section.Only differences here, we really didn't put our secretin a separate AML manifest.Okay? So this is one Kubernetes subjectand with the three hyphens we have separatedand then added one more secrets manifest here directly.Instead of having them in two separate files,both deployment and then it's own secretswe have put it in the same file. That's all.Okay, so now in addition to those environmental variableswe are going to add two more environmental variableswhich is notification service hostand then notification service port.And notification service port we know thatit is going to be 8096.That is good.Okay? So for notification service it is a 8096and user management it is 8095and the notification service host value is going tobe a notification cluster IP service.So you can go to this notification cluster IP serviceand get this name from metadataand then you can directly update it here.So now you have completed the adaptation meanslike we already have it updated here.So we just discussed about that.Okay, So now you knowthat user management will have a note port service herebecause that using the note port service onlywe are going to integrate itwith the ALB ingress controller.So which we discussed in ouringress controller section also.So this is the note port service standard templatewhich is coming from previous thing.Only thing is health check path is goingto be the same thing. Whatever we have earlier also.No changes to our note port servicefrom our user management note port servicefrom our previous templates.Okay, but now let's come backto our ingress as a cylinder ingress service.Okay? The name is going to be EKS microservices demo.This I have changed it. So, and the label.So you can put the label as the same.Okay? So you can map it to user management rest stop.Okay? So okay fine.So EKS microservices demo and if you see it hereso slash star SSL redirect is already there from beginningwhich we have seen.And in this, if you want to changewhat are the things you need to changeif you are doing it right?So primarily you need to change your SSL certificatepath here, right?Means like your SSL certificate informationwith your account ID and then all these thingsyou need to put in this template tomake it work for you and rest all.And then you need to update your own domain.So this is services.Q1cloud.com.So in your case it is going to be something else, right?See here this ALB ingress manifest also only two changesas we discuss it which is your certificateyou need to updateand then your domain name you need to update.And one thing you need to make a note of isthis one is going to send the traffic to user managementrest stop note port service, which is nothing but ourthis respect you note port service.Which eventually will catch up the pod using this selectorand then send that traffic to user managementmicroservice container here.Okay? So that's about it.So this is about the manifest discussionfrom 01 to 07 in this two lectures.Okay? So we have discussed everythingin our next lecture we'll go aheadand then deploy and then test everything.So I'll see you in the next lecture.Until then, bye bye. Thank you.
