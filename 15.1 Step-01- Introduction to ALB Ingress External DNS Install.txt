# 15.1 Step-01- Introduction to ALB Ingress External DNS Install

-: Welcome back.In this section, we are going to install the ExternalDNS.So before going and installing the ExternalDNSor understanding what all components involvedfrom ExternalDNS perspective,let's understand why do we need this ExternalDNS.In previous SSL demo sectionwe added AWS Route 53 DNS records manually.So we went into the Route 53 service inside hosted zonesfor that respective domain stack simplified dot com,we have added a DNS recordSSL demo 101 dot stack simplified dot com.But with ExternalDNS, we can automatically add itfor a Kubernetes ingress serviceor a Kubernetes service by defining it as a annotation.So if we add this annotation ExternalDNSdot all four dot Kubernetes dot io slash host nameand your DNS name, something like DNS test 2901or DNS dot,DNS abc dot R,my application dot stack simplified dot comSo if you add these things, then automaticallythose records will be added in the AWS Route 53 serviceinside the hosted zone as a DNS record.And in addition to that, you can create, update, deletethese DNS records from ExternalDNS itself.So let's see what all components involved in theExternalDNS relatedcontroller.So in AWS cloud, we already have the EKS cluster created.So for ExternalDNS, in the default name space,we are going to create a ExternalDNS service account.And this service account, right, will be associatedwith the IM role.So why we need to create this IM roleand what is the things present in the IM policyabout permissions that IM policy is going to have.So we are going to create a IM policywherein in that IM policy, it'll have the permissionsfor the AWS Route 53 resource for create, updateand then delete records inside that.And that IM policy will be associated with this IM role.And that IM role will be annotatedin this respective service account in Kuberneteswhich is nothing but ExternalDNS service account.And then we will also have the ExternalDNSrelated deployments cluster role,cluster role bindings all related objectsdeployed inside this default name space.So this ExternalDNS deployment will create theExternalDNS port for us.And whenever as a Kubernetes admin,if we deploy ingress serviceor a regular Kubernetes servicewith the annotation whatever we have specifiedrelated to ExternalDNS,so then ExternalDNS goes to the Kubernetes API serverand retrieves a list of resources likeservices or ingressesfrom the Kubernetes APS server to determine adesired list of DNS regards that need to be createdor updated or deleted from the AWS Route 53.So which means this ExternalDNS port will communicatewith this APS server and get a list of the ingressor regular services and search for the annotationrelated to ExternalDNS with the DNS namesand if it finds those DNS names inside those servicesare ingress services, so then it'll go aheadand then create or update or deletethose DNS records in the AWSRoute 53 related service.So this completes the introductory part of ExternalDNS.So in our next lecture, we'll go aheadand then practically implement this demo.So I'll see you in the next lecture.Until then, bye bye. Thank you.
