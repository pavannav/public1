# 3.4 Step-04- Docker Installation

-: Welcome back.So in this lecture we are going to look intoDocker installation.Okay, so from Docker installation's perspective.So let's click on the Docker installAnd we can see here so we can install the Docker engineand then it is supported in different platforms, Okay?So centOS, Debian, Fedora, and then Ubuntuand with x86, AMD64, ARM, ARM64, IBM Power,and then IBM Z series.So this is more or less like adocking engine directly installed on thoserespective operating systems.So in addition we have something called Docker Desktop.So we have the server versionand also we have the desktop version.So from server versions perspectiveall these operating systems are supportedand these models are supported.Okay, so x86, 64 or AMD 64, ARM, all those things.So now from Desktop's perspectiveso we can install Docker desktop for Mac on MacOSand also Docker desktop for Windows on Microsoft Windows 10.So let's see, start with the windows, right?So when we click on that Windows, so you can see hereget started with Docker for Windows.So we can directly install the Docker desktopon our Windows Machineand then test these things using these steps.So let's click on install Docker desktop for Windows.So we have the system requirements here.Our system should have Windows 10 64 bitpro, enterprise or education versionsand we should have the HyperVand then container, HyperV and containers Windows featuremust be enabled on our operating system,means like at the OS level, Okay?So now our machine should minimum have4GB of system RAM to operate or run this Docker desktop.Right, so once those are readyso we can download the Docker desktop installer dot exeand then run it, Okay?So we can start the Docker desktopand then we can start using it, okay?So you can see hereand then you can run the Microsoft Power shell.and then from there you can run the Docker run, Hello world.Right, and then you can test it.So in addition to that from Docker desktop onlyyou can even log into your Docker hub id, okay?So that's about the Windows installation.So this Docker desktop is going to be pretty easyfrom install perspectiveif you have the exact system requirements.So primarily like if your system is of Windows 64 bitand then Windows 10 you are runningand at least you have 4GB system RAM, then it is good, okay?But from my observationwhat I'm saying is usually 4GB system RAMif you install this Docker desktopthen your system will be at the disaster.This is the live experience whatever I am having, okay?So ensure that your system has 8GB RAM,so that you can even leverage that for using other tasksother than Docker desktop things, okay?So if it is only 4GB systemthen it only supports for Docker desktop.and then most of the things,whatever you run either your Spring boot IDEor Eclipse IDE or whatever you are running thereit is going to be a hell lot of a system,where it, it'll be very, very slow, okay?So 8GB ramp is always recommendedeven though it says 4GB herebut in real world it's 8GB is recommended.Okay, So that's about the Docker desktop on Windows.Okay, So moving on.So the next thing is Docker desktop on Mac, right?So if you see herethis is get started with Docker desktop for Mac, right?So install Docker desktop for Mac.So let's go there.And then, so if you see hereso from system requirements perspective,if you are on the latest OS, it is already supported.So MacOS must be version 10.13 or even newer.So this is the thing.And 4GB of ram, that's what they say as usual.And virtual box prior to version must not be installed.So all these things you can ignore, okay?So with this virtual box and all those things, okay?So directly download the Docker desktopand then move to the application folder.And then once you are move to the application folder,it'll, it'll be available as a docker.app, okay?So you can run that.and then once you run this docker.appso it'll start displaying here, you can seeyou can see it here, right?So Docker desktop is running on my Docker desktop.So it'll be available for us to run it,means like it'll be available for usto open it from here on, Okay?So it's engine version, composed version,Kubernetes version, all these details are provided here.So once our Docker desktop is up and runningon our Mac machinesso we can go here and then go to the preferences sectionand then ensure that this respective setting, okay,securely store Docker logins in MacOS key chain, okay?So this setting should be unchecked, okay?So I already have a running version here,so I'm not looking into it,but ideally this setting should be unchecked.So let's see more about it, okay?So Docker desktop on Mac has an issuewith the Mac OS key chain, okay?OS X key chain, okay?So to fix it, we need to perform these two steps.So one is go to Doc, Docker desktop changesopen Docker desktop preferences,which is nothing but whatever we have seen here, right?In preferences and uncheck the option namedsecurely store Docker logins in MacOS key chain.So that is first thing, okay?And once that is done,go to the conflict.json file in .docker folder.So this will be there in your root folder, okay?So if you go to your users, and then (indistinct)my, my home user is, my user's home is user (indistinct).And inside that I'll have a folder called .docker.And then inside that you'll have something calledconfig.json, okay?So currently I removed it earlierso I am not finding it herebut you'll find some line called cred store OSX key chainOkay, so this line, okay, so you just need to remove thisand then restart that Docker, okay?So restart that Docker daemon.So you can see here, you can see restart, okay?somewhere it should be there here, yeah.Restart the Docker daemon.So when you do that, so this issue will be resolvedif you face any issues related to this OSX key chainensure that you are going to troubleshootwhen it is on Mac using following things, okay?So other than that,on Mac you are not going to face any other issues.Only this issue you will faceand then you can fix it using these things, okay?So in our next lecture we'll focus on our flow onewhich is pull from Docker hub and then run the Docker image.So I'll see you in the next lecture.Until then, bye bye.Thank you.
