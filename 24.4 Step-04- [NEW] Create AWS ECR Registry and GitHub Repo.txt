# 24.4 Step-04- [NEW] Create AWS ECR Registry and GitHub Repo

Kalyan: Welcome back.Before going and creating a Elastic Container Registryand also GitHub Repository,let's have a very high level overview about GitHub, right?So, GitHub is a Version Control Service,which is hosted by Microsoft.And it is a global platform to host, manage,and collaborate on source code using Git.So, it's a very vastly used one.So, then why we are using GitHubinstead of using something from AWS,which is equivalent for GitHub?So, earlier we have used that,but now AWS Code can be this, the equivalent of GitHub,and it is now not available for any new AWS customers.So, which means they're going to deprecate this servicein long run or only use it only for the customers,whatever they have so far.So, GitHub became more popular.That and GitHub or GitLab.So, other services which are available with latest features.So, those things are recommended to use.One of them is GitHub.So, we are also going to use GitHubfor our EKS DevOps implementation here.So, we can create public and private repositoriesfor version control content,and also we can use it for code, documents, binaries.For all those things also, we can use GitHub.And it is highly secure and scalable platformtrusted by huge amountof open source communities and enterprises.So, it fully supports Git and its ecosystem.So, GitHub supports Git versions 2.x+.And authentication for GitHub,you can do SSH keys authentication,and also personal access tokens.In addition to that,if you want to use GitHub Enterprise version, right?So for them, for organizations,you can also use OAuth, SSO, and then SAML.And in addition to that, what we are going to do hereis we are going to create a new GitHub Repository.And we are going to clone that GitHub Repositoryas a Local Git Repo.And what we will dois we'll add all the Git files present here.So, if we go back to our Visual Studio Code here, right?So, this is the GitHub files we have here.So, all these things we are going to first put itin Local Git Repo, and then check in that codeand push that code to the GitHub Repository.So, this is what we are going to do.So, let's go to our GitHub Repository and review the steps,and create Elastic Container Registryand also GitHub Repository, and check in the code.In this lecture, we are going to createthe Elastic Container Registryfor our application docker image.And we'll also create the GitHub Repository.So, these two steps we are going to doas part of this respective lecture.So, let's go to our ECR and create a EKSDevOps-related ECR repo name as eks-devops.So, we'll go here and search for Elastic Container Registryand go to Elastic Container Registry,and go to Repositories here and click on Create Repository.And I'll just say eks-devops.And I'll try to use the image tag mutabilityas immutable image tags can't be overwritten.And encryption settings, I leave it to as is.And if you want to enable, right? Image scanning.You can enable here, but it is in a deprecated state.This setting is not available now.So, we leave it as is and then click on Create.So this creates a ECR repo for us.Now, we'll also go to GitHub, right?So, we'll go here to GitHub and in GitHub,so we'll go to Repositories,and we'll try to create a new repository.And the repository name is nothing but aws-eks-devops.So, that's the repository name we are going to use.And this is the AWS EKS DevOps implementationusing AWS CodePipeline, right?Or you can say AWS Developer Tools, okay?And then, I'll try to put it private for now.But later, I'll make this public.And this GitHub Repo should be accessible for you publicly.And I'll add a Read Me hereand I'll click on Create Repository.And this should create a new GitHub Repository for us.And then, I'll go here and copy this URL,and we'll go here to our local terminal here and clear.Clear, clear, come out of this AWS EKS Repo.And here I'll say git clone and I'll provide this URL.So, this is the one.In the SSH section, I have copied thisand I'm trying to clone this.And this should, when we see here,we should have our aws-eks-devops repo here.And in this repo,so if I go to the Visual Studio Code here, right?So, whatever in the GitHub files we have here, right?So, these are the GitHub files we haveand all these files I'm going to copy to our repo.So this is the one app1, kube_manifests, buildspec,build deploy, and Docker.So, these are the ones I'll copy here.And I'll go to aws-eks-devops and paste it.And you can see app1 folder with index.html,kube_manifests with three things.And important thing inside this is CONTAINER_IMAGEshould be in the uncommented state for DevOps pipeline.And the rest all of alb-ingress which you have updatedas part of prerequisite section as part of your environment.And you have the buildspec-buildand buildspec-deploy and Dockerfile.And the Read Me file here.So, these are the things present for you.Now, what we will do is we'll go hereand we'll say in aws-eks-devops repo, we'll say git status,and it will say these files were added just now.So I'll say git add . and got commit -am.And I can say Base commit.So, this is the first commit I'm doing.I can say base commit, and I'll say git push.So these are the commands which are already documented here,so you can run them here.Status, add, base commit, push, and then status.And if you click on this link, is it opening?Yeah, it is opening.So now, let me come back hereand you can see you have the app1 folder, kube_manifests,Dockerfile and buildspec-build, and buildspec-deploy.So, all the things are presentin your new GitHub Repository, which you have created.So if I want, I'll try to refreshand you can see all these are present here.Now, in our next lecture, we'll focus on the build stage.I'll see you in the next lecture.Until then, bye-bye. Thank you.
