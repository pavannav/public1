# 24.7 Step-07- [NEW] Build Stage- Create GitHub Connection from AWS Developer Tools

Instructor: Welcome back.In previous step, we have reviewedthe buildspec-build.yml file.Now we are going to create a GitHub connectionin AWS developer tools as part of this respective lecture.So which means we are going to make a secure connectionfrom AWS Cloud to GitHub website using this step.So we'll go to developer tools,so we can say CodePipeline or something like thatand go to our developer tools section.So this is the developer tools.And here in settings sectionyou'll find something called connections.And here in the connections tabwe'll try to create a connection.Now we'll click on create connectionand we are making a connection to GitHub.So there are multiple providers available here.You can make a connection to GitHub Enterprise Server,GitLab self manager, GitLab, Bitbucket,in the same way GitHub.So we are going to make this connection to GitHub.And the connection name we are goingto give is EKS DevOps GitHub connection.So I'll provide that connection name hereand click on connect to GitHub.And once we click on that,so we'll get the GitHub connection settings here.This is the connection name.So you can say, install a new app, click on this.And this should redirect us to our GitHub website.So provide your two factor authentication code.So I'll provide my authentication code here for my GitHub.And once it is done,so it will take you to the AWS connector for GitHub, right?So this should be present means likeif it is not installed, it is going to install.So in my case, it is already installed.So it is showing it here.It will install and show this which repository you needto provide access for.So I want to provide the access for AWS -eks-devops.So this is the one, so which we have,we have the entire code present, right?So kube manifest, docker file, build spec files, everything.So for that, we are trying to make a connection.So we'll select that repository here,AWS EKS and then DevOps.So this is the one.So this is selected, and we'll click on save.So once we click on save, this should redirect backto our connect to GitHub setting.And our app number will be auto-populated here,click on connect.And now this connection should be in the available state.So if you click on connections,you can see EKS DevOps GitHub connections,and you can see the information hereabout that respective connection.So this is the AR and for that connection,and it is saying it is available and provider is GitHub.And in GitHub also, if you want to see those information,you can go to GitHub and go to settings.And you can go to applications here, right?In the applications this is the AWS connected to GitHub.And if you click on configure, right,so you'll see the information about what all repositoriesfrom AWS, we have access.And for these two thingswith the different connection names,these two currently have the access.So that's about it.So let me go back and leave it here.Now let's go back to our connections section here.We have successfully established the connection.In next lecture, we'll focus on creating the core pipelineand implement this build part.So these two things we are goingto implement in the pipeline.So I'll see you in the next lecture.Until then, bye bye, thank you.
