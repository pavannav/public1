# 8.4 Step-04- Kubernetes Liveness & Readiness Probes Introduction

-: Welcome back,in this lecture we are going to understand about the probesavailable in the Kubernetes.So we have three types of probes available.So one is liveness probe, readiness probeand then startup probe.So liveness probe.So Kubelet uses liveness probe to knowwhen to restart a application container.So in general if our applicationhas some deadlock appeared inside thatand then it is not able to progress moreand then if liveness probe is detected as failed,then automatically the container will get restarted.So whenever we have application failure situationsand then if liveness probe fails,it will restart the container so that again,fresher instance of the container will start upand then start taking the traffic.So liveness probe will be used for that reason.So now the name here readiness probestates that Kubelet, Kubelet uses readiness probes to knowwhen a container is ready to accept the traffic.So until and unless the readiness probe is succeeded,so we will not allow that container to get the traffic.In simple terms whenever we start or deploy our application.So we will wait for the settings provided in readiness probeto succeed and once it succeeded then only it will allowthat traffic to that respective container.So when a part is not ready,it is removed from the service load balancerbased on the readiness probe signal.So you, if the part is not ready,then ideally it cannot be goand then add to the service load balances right?So in that cases, readiness probes will be very much helpfulin other terms, like you have a elastic load balancerwith application load balancer or any other load balancer,classic load balancer or whatever the load balancer may be.So this respective partif it need to go and then register inside the podthen readiness probes should be successful.In understanding and then handling those type of signalsreadiness probes will be helpful as an exampleand next is the startup probe.So kubelet uses startup probes to knowwhen a container application has started.So ideally when a container application has startedwhy the startup probe should know means,it's like why the kubelets should knowwhen the container application has started.So there will be several reasons for that, okay.So firstly, whenever we configure the start-up probeit automatically disables the livenessand then readiness probeuntil the startup probe is successful.That is one thing to avoid any interferencewith the app startup and second thing isthis can be used to adopt liveness checkson slow starting containers, avoiding them getting killedby the kubelet before they are up and running.So if sufficient amount of timeit already took to start the container,usually the default time-outs of podsand then Kubernetes will kick inand then it will go into an infinite loopof terminating and then restarting.So to avoid such situationsfor the slow starting containers, application containers,so we can use the start-up probe.An important thing here iswhenever the start probe is in actionuntil and unless it succeeds,it is going to disable the liveness and readiness probes,even they are defined in our manifest deployment, manifest.And next thing here is, options to define probes.So there are three options to define the probes.It's like in three ways we can define the probes.Either it is a liveness probe or readiness probeor start-up probe.So one is check using commands.So we'll have shell scripts, right?So we can create using shell that, net cat high fund Zlocalist 8, 0, 9, 5 to checkwhether that respective localistwith that port is available or not, or any other cat commandor whatever the command, whatever we want to useto ensure that our application is up.So we can use those shell commands, that is one way.And the second way is using the HTTP get request.So example like you have a health status space in,page in your application and when your application is upthen you can provide that health status page linkso that using HTTP get, it will go aheadand then check that respective pageis available for us or not.Or using plain PCP socket connection, which is nothing,but whether the port 8, 0, 9, 5 is listeningand then up and running or not.So in these three options we can define our probes.Whatever is applicable to whatever the probein our respective application situation, okay.So example readiness probe,I want to define using hash (indistinct)I will be fine with that,or in my liveness probe,I want to identify like in such a waythat using the NC hyphen Zand then localist 8, 0, 9, 5, so I'll assign for this.Anything anywhere you can use,but the way how you want to define itdepends on the your application contextand then how you have defined your core application, okay.So no restrictions on using which to which okay?So all three can be used for all three types of probes.So in our next lecturewe will focus on creating the livenessand then readiness probesfor our user management microservice and then test it now.Okay, I'll see you in the next lecture.Until then, bye bye.Thank you.
