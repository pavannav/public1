# 14.3 Step-03- Create SSL Certificate in AWS Certificate Manager

Instructor: Welcome back.Let's go back to our GitHub repository andwe are enteringinto the section 0804 ALB Ingress, SSL.So as part of step two,we already registered it,new domain named q1cloud.com.But, for all our examples are demos,we are going to use our standard domainStackSimplified.com here.This is just to learn howto register a domain name in Route 53.So now we'll go to step three,which is creating a SSL certificatein certificate manager.So let's go to AWS Management Consoleand go to certificate manager service.And in certificate manager service,we are going to create a new certificate andwe are also going to call this certificateas a wildcard certificate.Which means, with any domain, sub domain name,this respective certificate should work.Which means, we are going to giveor generate a certificate namedstar.StackSimplified.com.Or star.yourdomain.com.So which is called a wildcard certificate.So we'll click on request.And request a public certificate.And we'll click on nextand provide the fully qualified domain name here.So I'm going to provide itas star.StackSimplified.com, right.So this is called wildcard certificate, wherein,all the sub domains are supported here.Which means SSL demo 101StackSimplified.com,abc.StackSimplified.comso whatever may be my sub domain name.So everything will be supported herefor the SSL certificate.Which means, we'll not,whenever you are using this SSL certificateand using any sub domain name,we are not goingto get any SSL certificate popup erroron the browser.So, and we have providedthe qualified domain name here,star.StackSimplified.comand we need to select the validation method.So we are going to use the DNS validation method.And we'll click on request, right.And you can see here, let's wait for it.So you can see, this is the respective certificateit has created andit is saying pending validation.So let's go to that respective certificate here.And we can see, it, we need to create a recordsin Route 53 for the DNS validation to complete.So we need to complete the DNS validation step.So we'll click records in Route 53 here.So pending validation, so we'll clickon create recordsin Route 53, and it is going to automaticallyadd the records in Route 53.So create records.Records successfully added in Route 53.So let's click on the certificate ID andverify the same.So we can see here domains and it is success.And it has created a CNAME recordwith these names.So we can go to Route 53 surveys, right.And go to hostedzonesStackSimplified.com, right.So let's go to hosted zones here.Where is it?Here? And in hosted zones, We'll goto StackSimplified.com andin StackSimplified.com.So let's search further, CNAME recordwith this value.So copy andsee if we can find that same thing here.It successfully create that,that CNAME record number hosted zone,which means our DNS validation is successful.And this respective certificate status is issued.So this completes the creation of SSL certificate.In our next lecture, we are goingto work on Ingress SSL related annotations.So I'll see you in the next lecture.Until then, bye by.Thank you.
