# 4.6 Step-03- Kubernetes NodePort Service Introduction

-: Welcome back.In this lecture we are going to understandabout one more Kubernetes core concept named services.And in services specificallywe are going to focus on NodePort service.So why we are introducing this concept very earlyduring the pods demo itself.The reason is, so we have deployed a pod untiland unless we test it and then access itwe really don't know what is happening, right?So everything, if you test, then we know what is happening.So in that line, so we are going to introduce thiswhich means like whatever the pod we are going to deployon the Kubernetes cluster, we are going to expose itto the internet and then access itand then ensure that my application is running.So that gives you a good feel for us, right?So let's do that now.So we can expose an application running on a setof ports in Kubernetes using different services availablein Kubernetes.So those are ClusterIP, NodePort and LoadBalancer.So ClusterIP is specific to a clusterwhich means its boundary is only a clusterand inside the Kubernetes clusteryou can access your ports with ClusterIPif you have created a ClusterIP service for your portand NodePort is nothing but using the nodes portwhatever it is exposed, using that port,you will be able to accessyour application externally via internet.And another thing is LoadBalancer.So this is specifically for our cloud providers like AWSand then Google and then Azure.So they LoadBalancer services integrated with Kubernetesso that using LoadBalancer service,you will be automatically ableto create a AWS elastic load balancer or Azure load balanceror Google load balancer automatically.Moving on with NodePort service,so to access our application outside of Kubernetes clusterwe can use the NodePort service.So it exposes the service on each worker nodes,IP at a static port, nothing but the ClusterIP serviceto which the NodePort service routesis automatically createdwhenever a NodePort service is created.And the port range for our worker nodes is goingto be 30,000 to 32,767.So now let's understand the entire flowin a diagrammatical manner.So you see, you have a Kubernetes clusterwith a worker node here.So, and then you have deployed your port engine exportwhich is nothing but yourmy first port, whatever it is we have seen earlierwe have deployed it here.So now we have created a NodePort service.So what happens, right in a NodePort serviceyou'll have something called every service will haveits own port.So that is nothing but the ClusterIP service port.So your port port is 80and your ClusterIP service port is also 80.So the next thing is target port.So in the the service you'll have the definition called portwhich is 80, which is nothingbut the service port and the target port.And the target port is nothing but container port in a port.So this is nothing but your respective ports' port.So this is port port 80and the next thing is worker NodePort.So this is nothing but whatever it startsfrom 30,000 to 32,767.So whenever you are creating it using the imperative wayyou don't have an option to declare it the specific portbut whenever you're doing itin a declarative manner using YAML.So you can define one specific port numberfrom this respective range.So I can say 32 331 or something.And then you can specifically declare your portand then use it when you are using YAML.But when you are doing with imperative way using kubectlyou really don't have,and then automatically Kubernetes assigns one dynamic portbetween this range.So that's about the worker NodePortand then ClusterIP service port,and then container port in a port.So now the next thing is whenever a user triesto access using worker node IP and then NodePortso the traffic comes via our worker nodes, respect to portwhich is in between this range.And then it will sendto that ClusterIP service under that on port 80.And then from there it will send to the target portwhich is nothing but the 80 port on our portand then our application will be accessible.So this is about the NodePort service on a very high level.So in our next lecture we'll focuson the entire demo for this one.So I'll see you in the next lecture.Until then, bye bye, thank you.
