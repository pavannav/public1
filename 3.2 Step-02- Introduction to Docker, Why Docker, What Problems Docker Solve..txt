# 3.2 Step-02- Introduction to Docker, Why Docker, What Problems Docker Solve.

-: Welcome back.So in this lecture we are going to focuson zero one Docker introduction.So as part of Docker introduction, we are going tosee what problems we have with the current traditionalinfrastructure and then how Docker is going to solve them.In addition, what are the advantages of using the Dockerwe are going to look into?So for presentation slides, you can click on this linkand then view the presentation slides.So the slides, whatever we are showing in this lecturesis also available here for you for download.So moving on.So if you goto the zero one Docker, so we have something calledDocker architecture, right?So in addition to Docker introductionwe are also focusing on Docker architecture.So Docker architecture is like a seriesof thumb Docker and introduce, which we need to be awareof to understand and then play with Docker effectively.So what is Docker Damonand then what is Docker client or what are Docker images?And then what are Docker containersand what is Docker registry or Docker hub?So all these terms,whatever is introduced in Docker.So we are going to understand as partof the Docker architecture, Docker terminology section.So let's go back over introductory slides and then moveon with the stuff, okay?So in Docker introduction.So first thing is what problems we havewith the traditional infra.So let's see, what are the problems we are having?So in the traditional infra,we have the hardware infrastructure. On top of thatusually we install our respect, your operating systemlike Ubuntu, [Unintelligible],Red Hat or Cent Os, whatever it is.And then when we are planning to deploy our applicationsit's equal and OS level libraries we installand also it's equal in dependencies we install.So let's consider we have web server says [Unintelligible]and then apps server says some spring boot applicationswhich are of Java type.And then we also have databases as my skill.So for those things, what are the OS libraries required?We need to install them.And then also the dependencies.Example, if you want to run some JBoss or Tomcatsthen you also install the JDK and all those things, right?So like this, what all dependenciesof libraries and dependencies are requiredwe need to install and then handle them.So now if you see installationand configuration will be a biggest problemin that traditional approach, okay?So it is going to be time consuming and we need toperform all these library install, dependency, installand then these vendor product installs, all these thingsacross our environmentslike dev, QA, stagingand then all the production environments.So multiple times we need to implement them.But when you consider Docker, so from Docker perspectivepackage it once and then leverage itor use it across all the environments.So one time work and thenafter that everything is like packagedand then it can be leveraged across environments.Compatibility and dependency, right?So we need to keep resolving issues relatedto libraries and then dependencies continuously.So if we do the voice upgrade, then what happens?Again, the libraries, some libraries might breakand then we need to fix those librariesor we need to fix the dependenciesor we need to upgrade the dependencies.So like that we face multiple issuesfrom compatibility and then dependency issues when we areon the traditional infra.and inconsistencies across environments.So if you have multiple five dev environmentsfive QN environments, five staging environmentsand two production environmentsit is very hard to track changes across these environmentsand they end up with multiple inconsistencies.But when in Docker, if you package it once and leveraging itacross all the environments, so then there is no chanceof missing or having the inconsistenciesin our Docker images.Operational support.So we need more resources to handle operational issueson a day to day basisbecause of your are going to scale your hardwareinfrastructure heavily to support your operating systemand then needs from your environment's perspective, right?So the server support hardwareand then software installationsand then patching, patching villagesall these things we need to spend lot of moneyand then lot of resources to handle all those things.When it comes to Docker, all these things will besimplified.So in addition, developer environments.So when a new developer joins the teamthe time it takes to provision is development environmentin traditional approaches, time taking.And even mostof the time it'll not be a hundred percent rightBut when we consider our developer environmentsare Dockerized, then it is going to be a minuteor less than a minute two provision that respectto developers and environment.So all these problems, what are we are seeingin traditional infra can be easily solvedusingDocker.Moving on.So let's see how a physical mission lookslike when we install the application.So we have hardware infrastructureoperating system, libraries, dependencies installedon that operating systemand we have deployed the web servers, app serversand then databases on that physical missions.So let's see, from physical mission to virtual missionswhat is the difference, right?So we have the hardware infrastructureand in virtual missions we have the hypervisor.And on hypervisor we create the virtual missions.So we have the operating system for each virtual missionand then we'll install the librariesand then dependencies for those virtual missions.And then we'll have the equivalent containersequivalent vendor products installedon those virtual missions.Okay? So now if you see herethis is a little bit simplified versionfrom the physical missions.But still the librariesand then dependencies and then all these incompatibilitiesare still going to be thereacross environments and then you need to solve these things.But in virtual missions also there is a conceptof creating a virtual mission imageand then leverage it across environments.We have seen that, but stillwith IP address changing, DNS name changing, and then lotof other things we need to bring into the picturewhen we are even using the virtual missions.OVA images, or whatever is it.Okay, so moving on to Docker.So when we, when it is installed on a physical missionwith Docker, it is going to look like this.Okay? So we have a hardware infrastructureand we have the operating system on that.We are going to install the Dockerand then we are going to run the containers.So each container is a combinationof its own libraries dependenciesit will have its own operating system inside that.And then we'll be installing the Nginxor even the app servers and then databases, whatever it isthey'll have their own libraries and then dependencies.So that once andfor all we are solving the libraries and dependencies.And then we are going to packageand then use that Docker image across all environments.So if you see here, so on the operating systemwe are going to install the Docker in the same way.If you see virtual missions with the Dockerso we have the hardware infrastructurewe have the hypervisor, andon that we are going to have theoperating system for that virtual mission.And then we are going to install the Docker.And then from there we are going to deploy ourDocker images as containers on them.So we can run multiple Docker containersin a single virtual mission, right?Based on the memory and then CPU limits, whatever we have.So like this, you can run hundred containersor 200 containers, all those things.So nothing, there is no dependencyfrom our perspective from either hardware infrastructureor hypervisor perspective.Okay? So if this respective operating system is allocatedwith equal and CPU and then ramand then if those are minor containersthen you can run any number of those things.Okay? So, but with that saidthe core thing here is like Docker is flexiblefor us the way how we want to use itwe can use it in a better manner.Moving on.So what are the advantages of using Docker, right?So why containers?So they are flexible.So even the most complex applications can be containerizedin our recent days.So they are very lightweight and containers leverageand share the host kernel, making them much more efficientin thumbs off system resources.Done virtual missions, so they're very portableso you can build locallydeploy to the cloud and then run anywhere.So they're very loosely coupled.These Docker images or Docker containers areloosely coupled.Containers are highly self-sufficientand encapsulated allowing us to replaceor upgrade one withoutdisrupting others.So they are very much scalable.You can increaseand automatically distribute container replicasacross a data center.So they are very much secure container supplyaggressive constraints and isolations to processeswithout any configuration required on the part of the user.So with that saidthe Docker containers are flexible, lightweight, portableloosely coupled, scalable, and then even secure.So now moving on, we'll, we'll be lookinginto the Docker architecture in our upcoming lecture.So I'll see you in thenext lecture.Until then, bye bye.Thank you.
