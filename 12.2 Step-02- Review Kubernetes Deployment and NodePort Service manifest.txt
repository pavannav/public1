# 12.2 Step-02- Review Kubernetes Deployment and NodePort Service manifest

-: Welcome back.Let's go back to our GitHub repositoryand we are in 0802 ALB Ingress basics.And as part of step one,we already understood about what we are going to implementas part of this section.So now we are in step two where we are goingto review the app one deployment Kubernetes manifest.So we need to goto zero one kube manifest default backend folder.So if you go back to our Visual Studio code here,in 0802 and in ALB Ingress basics.So you'll have the demo onewhich is zero one kube manifest default backend,and you'll have the demo two,which is zero two kube manifest rules.So if you go inside this,we'll find something called zero one Nginx appone deployment and then node port service.So this is our standard deployment and node port service.So we will review on a high leveland then move on to the next step.So, if you see here APA version is apps V1and kind is deployment and metadatais app one Nginx deployment, right?And in the spec you have replicas.We are going to create one portand in selector match labelsyou have provided the label as app equal to app one Nginx.The same we are going to use in our node port service.We'll see that later.And in template you have the metadata labelapp app one Nginx.And in deployment spec and inside that templateand in template you'll have the pod specificationand you have the containers.And inside the containers,the first container you have defined inside this portis app one Nginxand you are bringing the containerfrom stacksimplify/kube Nginx app one 1.0.0and ports we are going to use the container port S80.So this is the deployment manifestand here is the node port service.And in node port service you can see API version is V1and kind is service.And in metadata you'll find app one Nginx node port serviceis the name of this service and inspect, right?So let's ignore these labels and annotations for now.So let's come back to the service spec.And you are saying that service type has node portand selector label you can see app app one Nginx,the same whatever you have seenin the selector match labels of your deployment.So which means any traffic comingto this app one Nginx node port servicewill be sent to the portswith this app app one Nginxmatch labels related ports, right?So which means it'll send to this portscreated by this respective deployment.So, now let's come back here and see the ports.The service port is port 80and the target port,which is nothing but your port of your portis also port 80,or you can say that container port is 80.So now let's come backand we have successfully reviewedour Nginx app one deployment and node port service.In our our next lecture,we are going to go ahead and then do a live template writingfor our ALB Ingress, right, manifest,which is zero two ALB Ingress basic.yaml.So, I'll see you in the next lecture.Until then, bye bye.Thank you.
