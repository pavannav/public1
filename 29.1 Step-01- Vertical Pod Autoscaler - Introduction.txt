# 29.1 Step-01- Vertical Pod Autoscaler - Introduction

-: Welcome back.In this section, we are going to understand aboutVertical Pod Autoscaler related auto scaling concept.So Vertical Pod Autoscaler automatically adjust theCPU and memory reservations for our Podsto help right size our application deployed.So, this adjustment can improve cluster resource utilizationand free up CPU and memory for other Pods.So the main benefits include cluster nodes areused efficiently because Pods use exactly what they need.So Pods are scheduled onto nodesthat have the appropriate resources available.And we don't have to run time consuming benchmarkingtasks to determine the correct values for CPUand then memory requests.So maintenance time is reducedbecause the autoscaler can adjust CPU and thenmemory requests over time without any action on our part.So these are the very high level thingsabout Vertical Pod Autoscaler.So moving on,so we have three types of VPA components available,which means VPA is not out of the box availableunlike HPA in the Kubernetes man, Kubernetes resources okay.So VPA is an additional resource unit toinstall that in your Kubernetes.So as part of that installation, so we are going toget three components from VPA site.So VPA admission hook, VPA recommender,and then VPA updater.So VPA admission hook.So what it is,so every Pod submitted to the Kubernetes cluster goesthrough this web hook automatically,which checks whether a Vertical Pod Autoscaler object isreferencing this pod are one of its parentslike ReplicaSet deployment is referencing this information.So if it is referencing then it moves onto the next step.Okay, so what is VPA Recommender, right?So VPA Recommender is nothing but it connectsto the metric server in the cluster and then fetcheshistorical and then current usage data, like CPU and memory,for each VPA enabled Pod and generates recommendationsfor scaling up or down the requests and limitsof those respective Pods.So what does VPA updater do?So it runs every one minute,if a Pod is not running in the calculated recommendationrange, it evicts the it evicts the current currentlyrunning version of that Pod so it can restartand go through the VPA admission web hookfor that respective Pod, which will change the CPUand memory settings for it before it can start.So we are going to execute it now,and then with HandsOn demo and then then see how it happens.So we are going to put some load on our applicationonce we deploy and also write the VPA manifestand then deploy it and then understand moreabout when we put the load, how our CPU and memory resourcesof our respective Pod increases automatically based on VPAwhatever we have configured we are going to look into.So I'll see you in the next lecture.Until then, bye bye.Thank you.
