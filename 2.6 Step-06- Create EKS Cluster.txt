# 2.6 Step-06- Create EKS Cluster

-: Welcome back.So in this lecture we are going to createthe EKS cluster now.So let's go into zero one zero to create EKS cluster,and then node groups.So when we go to the step zero one here,step 00 we just now completed,which is nothing but understanding about EKS core objects,control plane, worker nodes,and then far get profiles and then BPC in detail.So now we are going to go into step zero onewhich is nothing but create EKS cluster, using eksctl.So one important thing here we need to understand islike it'll take 15 to 20 minutes tocreate the cluster control plane.And what is this command?So using eksctl create cluster,we are going to create the cluster and its nameis going to be EKS demo one.And the region weare going to create this cluster is in US east one.And my EKS cluster should be presenting US east one Aand then one B availability zone.So I'm restricting my cluster at one A and then one B.So if you don't give this zones then it is going toautomatically select the zones.And if it selects one Dor some other zones, most of the time we get errorabout the availability of workloads present there.Means like availabilityof servers and all those things.So because of that I specifically say one Aand then one B here.In addition to that.So without node group, which means likeif you don't give this additional parameterwith eksctl create cluster itselfit is going to automatically create the node group alsofor us with two nodes inside that with M four large.And then it is going to apply directlythe production grade cluster creation automaticallywithout our involvement.So what happens at that point islike we are going to get a clusterwithout any knowledge of what it is creating.So that's the reason what I've done islike I have created a specific stepfor node groups separately.So as we've seen earlier how EKS works.So we are going to create cluster which is nothingbut control plane separatelyand also the node groups separately.So instead ofby using the default things and then using defaultwe customize it to see in a way how we need it.So that's the reason I said that without node group.So let's go aheadand then execute this command on our command line, right?So it is going to take close to 1520 minutes to create this cluster.So I'm going to pause the video andonce it is created so we can move on with the next steps.So if you see here in this, so it has selected the subnetsfor US east one A publicand then one more.It is again another public subnet it has selectedand it is using the Kubernetes version 1.16.As on today that is the latest as per EKS.So it means like even the 1.18 is real latestas Kubernetes.io.So it'll be two versions lesserthan EKS is using two versions lesserthan the live Kubernetes.So, and another thing is it is creating the clusterin US east one with the name EKS demo one.And one more thing here islike you can see public access prooffor our API server in point and private access is false.So this is nothing but if you remember we discuss itabout our API server endpoint should be accessiblefor the worker nodes.So it is going to meanslike our Kube API server endpoint is going tobe publicly accessible for us.That's the reason it is saying public access,true.So that's about it.So it is going to create a control plane nowand I'll pause the video until it is created and then ready.So our cluster got created now and we can see it alsoupdated the Kube config file in my dot Kube folderin my home user home directory.So, which is nothing but it also updated the clusterKube config file.So which means like my Kube CTL context is directly pointedto this cluster.So we can even directly check Kube ctl, get nodes and seeif we have any nodes in this cluster.So without any node group, we have created it.Ideally no node should be present here.So in our next upcoming step anywaywe are going to create the node group separately.So no resources found in our default name space.So now moving on.So let's go ahead and then list our clusters.So eksctl get clusters.So it'll list the clusters created for usin our AWS account in US East one North Virginia region.So let's see how many clusters it has created.Ideally we have created only EKS demo one.It need to list the EKS demo.So we can see it here.EKS demo one created in the US East one region.So I'll see you in the next lecture.Now next lecture will focus on IAM OIDC provider.Until then, bye bye.
