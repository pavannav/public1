# 19.1 Step-01- Introduction to Ingress Target Type IP Mode

-: Welcome back.In this section we are going to learn aboutKubernetes Ingress concept name target-type: ip.So let's understand what is ALB IngressKubernetes target-type annotation first.So this target-type annotation specifieshow to route traffic to your ports,which is nothing but your Kubernetes portsfrom your Application Load Balancer.And we have two ways to do thatin our ALB Ingress target types.One is instance mode and another one is IP mode.Let's understand the instance mode first,and then we'll move to the IP mode.So instance mode will route trafficto all EC2 instances within the clusteron the nodeport open for your service.Which means, if you remember our previous examples also,we have created an app1, app2, app3 deploymentand we also created an app1, app2, app3 nodeport service.So the request coming to your Application Load Balancerwill go to that Kubernetes NodePort service.And from that Kubernetes NodePort serviceit is going to your application port.And this Kubernetes NodePort service will haveyour worker node IP:port from that respective node.And this service must be of type nodeportor loadbalancer to use the instance mode.That's clear.We have implemented the NodePort servicefor our previous examples.And the default target-type is instance modein our Ingress resources.Which means we don't need todefine this annotation in Ingress.By default, it takes instance mode.So if you see our Ingress templates definedprevious to this demo, nowhere we have definedalb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-type instance.So why we don't need to define that?Because the default target-type is instance modeand we don't need to define this.Now let's understand what is this target-type IP mode.IP mode will route traffic directly to the podwhich means when the request comes from the internetto your Application Load Balancer,from there that request will directly goto your Kubernetes pod.So there is no middle man like KubernetesNodePort service involved here,and IP mode is required for sticky sessionsto work with Application Load Balancer.So that is the core reason for implementing the IP modewhen you are using the EC2 worker nodes.But when you are using the Fargate,definitely you only need to use IP mode.And when we are implementing our learning,the Fargate concepts,we'll also know more about IP mode there.And also they're the only option for youwhenever you want to use AWS Fargate server list.At that point in time you need to use IP mode onlyand need to define the annotation explicitlyas target-type: ip.This completes the introductory partof target-type: ip.So in our next lecture we are going to practicallyimplement this concept and understand about it.So I'll see you in the next lecture.Until then, bye bye.Thank you.
