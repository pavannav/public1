# 7.8 Step-08- Test User Management Microservice with MySQL Database in Kubernetes

-: Welcome back!In this lecture we are going to create the usermanagement service deployment and then note port service.So as part of that we are going to create,all the things one more time.If you see here, so whatever we have created earlier,which is nothing but QCTL get all, so thestorage class, and then persistent volume claim,and already deployment of MySQL,and then MySQL plus I try service everything I have deleted.So there is there is a reason for it.So let's go ahead and then observe why we have deleted.So whenever you're executing this QCTL command,so which is apply hyphen cube manifests,you should be in those respective folder for that section.So we are in 0 4 0 3 User Management Microserviceswith MySQL db, right?So inside cube manifest you'll have all the five things nowokay, so 0 1, 0 2, 0 3, 0 4, 0 5, 0 6, and then 0 7.All these seven things templates,whatever is there, all are available.So let's come out of cube manifest,and then say QCTL, apply, hyphen F cube manifest.Okay? So it is going to create all this stuff now for us.Okay? Which is nothing but storage class,persistent volume claim, config map, deployment service,for my skill and deployment service,for our user management service.So let's see that parts now.Okay, so now container is creating, but alreadyuser management microservice container already got created.So if you see locks minus F,So what happens is before MySQL got created,user management microservice got created.So, but it'll fail because MySQL is not ready.It'll restart the port.So you can see here now here, Okay?Because it's MySQL is not available.It'll restart once, and after thatagain in the next restart, if itfinds the port, then it is going to MySQL portthen it is going to connect to the MySQL.Okay, so now let's see what happens.Okay, see now it is User ManagementMicroservices Authenticate.So it has restarted the container for the fact,that for the first time MySQL is not ready.So to identify this type of issues,I have deleted everything and then whatever we have doneduring the MySQL section and then recreated now.So, how to solve this?Okay, So which means ourapplication container should not startbefore the MySQL container starts.So how to do this?In our next section we are going to look into.But for now our application is up and runningwhich is User Management.And also our MySQL project up and running, right?So if these two are up and running,What is our current job?Is to get that note port, note portand note IP address, right?So 3 1 2 3 1, whatever we have given,directly in our service.So we'll get that, and we'll also get thenote public IP address and take that,and then access it, and then test it on the browser.So this is the external IP.So we will use this IP.Any one of the IP we can use it.So let's go here.Right?-: So STTP, colon, slash, slash, IP, colonand then 3 1 2 3 1 is our note port.And the context should be user MGMT,slash, health status page, for our microservice application.The same thing will be present,for you in our raw documentation.Also here, so if you see here,this is the one EKS for cannot public IP 3 1 2 3 1,is the port and user MGMT slash health status.Okay, So this tells that our microserviceapplication, is just up running.So let's access this and see, what happens, Okay.So if I make it bigger, User Management Servicesup and running and the version is V.1.So you can very clear to see that our RestApplication is up and running or our MicroserviceApplication is up and running.So in addition to that, if you want to seeQCTL get storage class, comapersistent volume claim and also persistent volumeyou can even see those things now.So storage class, EBS, CSI,AWS is provision and it's a volume claim,also bounded to the volume, and this is the volumewith 4GB capacity. Okay?So which is here right?Default EBS, MySQLSo that's about it.So, now in our next lecture we are going to focuson Test the Rest services present in this UserManagement Application using Postman.Okay, So I'll see you in the next lecture.Until then, bye bye.Thank you.
