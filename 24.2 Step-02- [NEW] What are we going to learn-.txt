# 24.2 Step-02- [NEW] What are we going to learn-

Instructor: Welcome back.In this lecture we are going to learnabout what we are going to build as part of this section.So here we are going to build a CodePipelineor a EKS DevOps pipelinewherein for source we are going to use GitHub repositoryand for build and deploy phaseswe are going to use AWS CodeBuild.And we are also going to add a deployment approval processafter build completion phase and before deployment phase.And for all these thingswe are going to use AWS CodePipeline.So once we implement this demo,so the entire pipeline is going to look this way.So let's also go back to GitHub repositoryand see what all steps involvedas part of this demo implementation.So we will go to AWS EKS Kubernetes-Masterclassand here is the 11 new DevOpswith AWS developer tools and GitHub.So this is a older demo where we have used CodeCommitand now we are going to use,means like we are going to decommission thisand we are going to use GitHub for the same.So CodeCommit is not available for any new customers.So they're planning to deprecate itand use it means like whatever the old customers are thereonly for them, it is going to be present.So accordingly,I'm trying to use most generalized version control system,which is GitHub.So now we'll go back hereto 11 new DevOps with AWS developer tools and GitHub.So we are going to understand the DevOps conceptslike continuous integration,continuous deployment or delivery.So this one we have already seenin our introductory section.And now here we are going to use GitHubfor version control and CodeBuild for build processand also for deployment process.And whole thing, the entire pipelinewe are going to implement using AWS CodePipeline.And what are we going to use,means like what are we going to learnas part of this is we are going to fast createa elastic container registryand we are going to build the docker imageand push the docker image to this elastic container registryand that using our pipelines.And we have something called a code which we are goingto check into our GitHub.So let's see that on a very high level.So if we go back to our visual studio codeand if you go to 11 new DevOpswith AWS developer tools and GitHub section,so you'll have something called GitHub files folder.And in this GitHub files folder,so you are going to let me minimize all these things, yeah.And in this GitHub files folder,you are going to have app1.So in app1 folder you're going to have index.html.So let's assume that this is a simple application.So we are going to build lot of complex pipeline hereand lot of other things.So buildspec build and then buildspec deploy.So all these things are complex,we really don't want our application codeto be a super complex one here.So we'll try to use a simple application,but anything, whatever the application we try to useaccordingly, those related changes we need to implementbased on that respective application.But here we are going to focuson a simple nginx static application,index.html file,and it is present in app1 index.html folderand it's equal.And means like to build a docker image,we need a docker fileand we are going to use FROM and COPY commands.So from nginx as the base imageand we are going to copy this app1 directlyto /usr/share/nginx/html app1.So that this index.html will be present inside it.So like this, we are going to build a simple,very simple docker image,and in addition to that,we have something called Kubernetes Manifest.So we have a simple nginx deployment fileand we have something called nginx NodePort serviceand also nginx load balancer, right?So application load balancer related things.So these are the things which we have already implementedin our previous demosand we are going to review them in detailin our prerequisite section also.So we'll see that in our next lecture.And in addition to that we are also goingto have something called buildspec build.ymland also buildspec deploy.yml.And buildspec build,you are going to just build your docker imageand push it to ECR repository.So in the pipeline it comes here in the build phaseand for buildspec deploy.So you are going to deploy the container imagewhich you have push to ECR repo to your EKS cluster.So all those related stepswill be present in buildspec deploy.yml.So that comes here under deploy section.So these things we are going to implement now practically.I'll see you in the next lecture.Until then, bye-bye.Thank you.
