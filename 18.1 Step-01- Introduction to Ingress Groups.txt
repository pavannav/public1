# 18.1 Step-01- Introduction to Ingress Groups

-: Welcome back.In this section we are going to learn about ingress groupsand also implement a practical demo for ingress groups.So, without ingress groupswe used to define our configurationsin a single ingress resource.So let's understand what is the drawbacks ofnot using ingress groups in a larger configurations.So example, like in our current use caseswe have app one, app two, and then app three applicationsand we have their own deployment and then noteport service Kubernetes manifest.And for all these three apps,we used to have a single ingress resource.Maybe, my apps is the ingress resource name.And for these three appsthe routing rules we have defined in a single file.So single ingress resourcefor all three apps we have created so far.And, any changes to any of these appsyou need to go into that respective ingress resource.For all the three apps you have only one ingress resourceand you need to go inside that ingress resourceupdate that and then deploy those changes.And the important thing here is,if you have three appsit is fine, but if we have 50 apps or hundred appsand all these hundred apps needs different rules embeddedin your application load balancerand those rules need to be managedin a single ingress Kubernetes manifest.So if that is the case then, maintaining that singlefile becomes tedious and also confusing.So the ingress groups concepts helps usin segregating theconfig in different fileswith the different ingress resource names.But you can merge them together tocreate a single application load balancer.So with ingress groups, we can simplify ourKubernetes ingress manifest when dealing withmultiple apps requiring a single application load balancer.So with ingress groups what happens is,so you can see you have app one, apptwo, and app three related deploymentand note port service related Kubernetes manifest.So for app one you'll create the app one ingress resourceand you'll define the app one related rules onlyinside that.And for app two,you will define the app two ingress resourceand you'll define the app two related rules inside that.And for app three also, you'll do the same thing.So these three are three different Kubernetes manifestsand nowall together, right?Using the ingress groups conceptand using the ingress group annotation.So you will group them togetherwith my apps dot whatever the name you want.So these ingress resourcesfrom web are whatever it is, right?So I just gave the name as my apps dot web for my group.So which means I'm going to have a ingress group annotationin ingress service app one ingress, app two ingress, andapp three ingress.And I'm going to say all these three ingress belongto my apps dot web ingress group.And in addition to that, I am also going todefine the priority for these ingress rules.So I'm going to say app one ingress is going tohave priority 10 app to English is going to have priority 20and app three is going to have priority 30.So at this point what happens is, in theapplication load balancer, it is going toput the rules in that same order.And in addition to that, so you are callingfrom application load balancer perspective thisas a priority, but from ingress perspective you call itas ingress group order, right?So you need to define the ingress group orderas 10 ingress group order as 20 and ingress group orderas 30 and there will be times you call it as arule priority number.And if you see here, so, theingress load balancer namefor all these three things is going tobe same ingress groups demo.So which means this load balancer named relatedannotation will be there in all three filesand you'll have the name as ingress groups demo.But the name of your ingress service, rightin the metadata you provide the name, right?So that can be app one ingress or app two ingressor app three ingress whatever,based on your ingress service name.But all these things will be connectedto a single load balancer, which is ingress groups demo.And all these three things will have a same ingress groupwhich is my apps dot web.So now let's move on to next thing.So let's understand a little bit here.Ingress Group feature enables you togroup multiple ingress resources together.So the controller will automatically merge ingress rulesfor all ingresses within ingress groupand support them with the single application load balancer.And very, very important note here is in additionmost annotations defined on an ingress only appliesto the paths defined by that ingress.And finally, so this is the sample.So for the ingress groups, you are going touse the group dot name and also group dot order.In every ingress resource you are going to add these twoannotations and provide that ingress resource belongs towhich group and also what is the priorityof that ingress resource.So in our case, in 0 8 2 ingress group section, we arein Kube manifest.We are going to have app one folder, app two folderand app three folder.And in app one folder you will havethe 0 1 SNCs app, one deployment and note port service.And it's 0 2 app one ingress dot yaml.Same for app two, 0 1 SNCs app two deploymentand note port service and 0 2 app two ingress.So in app one ingressyou'll have only app fund related rules.And in app two ingress you'll have onlyapp two related rules.And in app three you'll have only app three related rules.So three ingress Kubernetes manifest creates threeingress resources in Kubernetes andall three will be merged to create a singleAWS application load balancer.That's what is the core concept here.This completes the introductory part of ingress groups.In our next lecture, we are going to go aheadand then review this cube manifestand then practically implement the use case.So I'll see you in the next lecture.Until then, bye bye.Thank you.
