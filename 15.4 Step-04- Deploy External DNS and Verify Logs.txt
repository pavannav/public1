# 15.4 Step-04- Deploy External DNS and Verify Logs

-: Welcome back.As part of step five,we are going to deploy the external DNS.So let's go to our terminal here,and we'll enter into the section 08new year B application load balances.And inside that, we will go to 0807 0806,which is nothing but deploy external DNS.And we'll say kubectl.And if you want, we can verify a less alert yearand Kube manifest.You'll find the 01 deploy external DNS.YML.So I'll say kubectl apply hyphen F and Kube manifest.So this should create or deploy the external DNS for us.So let's wait for it to complete.So we can see here,the service account external DNS configure cluster rolland then cluster roll binding createdand deployment external DNS also created.And this warning, you can ignore.So that is fine.So now let's come back hereand run the command kubectl,get all from the new default namespace.So all the deployments and whatever the resources presentin default namespace, we are going to get here.So we can see here, external DNS pod is runningand we can see external DNS related deploymentand external DNS related ReplicaSet.And if we want,we can also list only the external DNS pod here.So get pods, right?And now you can see external DNS pod running.So if you want to verify the logs,so we can run this commandto verify the external DNS pod logs here.And we can see if there are any errors or anything also,we can see here.All you can see is everything is working as expectedand didn't see any errors here, right?So using in-cluster conflicts service tokenand created Kubernetesclient applying provider record filter,all are info messages.So all are info messages.So there are no errors inside this.So if any errors also, it will be continuously throwingand then we can easily find it, right?So this completes that deploymentof our external DNS related things.So what we have done, so we have created a IAM policyand we have created a Kubernetes service accountwith IAM role and annotatedthat IAM Kubernetes service account with the IAM role ERN.So all those things we have done using eksctl,create IAM service account command.And using that single command only further,we have also associated the IAM policy to IAM role.After that, we have updatedthe external DNS default manifest,which will create the external DNS related service accountand cluster role, cluster role binding,and also it has created the deploymentwhich created the external DNS pod.So this Kubernetes manifest, whatever it has created,whatever it has providedis from the external DNS related documentation.Ideally, already we have created this part.So we really don't need to have this here.We can remove it, if we don't want.But I took how the documentation is present,exactly how took in then put it here.But that's the reason you can see this error alsowhatever you're seeing, right?This a warning message.Also came because it is sayingthat you already have the external DNSand then why you are trying to reconfigure itor something like that.But ideally, we don't need this part,but it is given in the documentation I have, I read it.So deploy external DNS-related Kubernetes manifest.So we already using eksctl create IAM service account,we have created external DNS,and we have also annotated thatwith this respect to IAM role,which means this part here is not needed,so this service account part.But anyway, so it is part of the documentation manifest.So that's the reason I have put it in,which is no harm for us.So that is fine for us, right?So now, let's come backand in our next section or in the next demo,we are going to focus on using this external DNS conceptsand adding the annotation in our Ingress serviceand then test it whether our DNS recordsget automatically created in Route 53 hosted zones.So I'll see you in the next lecture.Until then, bye-bye.Thank you.
