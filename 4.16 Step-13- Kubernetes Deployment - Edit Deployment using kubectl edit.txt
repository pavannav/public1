# 4.16 Step-13- Kubernetes Deployment - Edit Deployment using kubectl edit

Speaker: Welcome back.In this step, we are going to update our applicationfrom V2 to V3, using the kubectledit deployment option.So this is very important option.And then this is the optionwe are going to usein real time.Most of the time, whenever,running deploymentswe have.So Kubectl, edit,deployment, deployment, nameand then we'll go insidethat deployment specand then update it.So that's the reason.So just look into it.You see it here.kubectl, edit, deployment,and then space.My first deployment meanslike deployment nameor slash whatever it is.Okay, so and then you are going to goto container spec dot container start imageand change your image versionfrom 2 dot 0. 0. 2. 3. 0. 0.So let's go ahead and then do that now.So whenever you are doing it,you can even say that youif you want to save the version historyyou can say that hyphen iPhonerecord is equal to true.So let's go here.And so I can even saykubectl edit deployment,my first deployment and it isnothing but hyphen iphone.Record is equal to true.Right?And I'm going to go at the endwhich is nothing but escape shift G.And I'll go up andif you see this is the spec dot container start image.So I am going to change from 2 to 3 here.Three zero two zero and I'm going to save it.Escape : W, Q, right?So now deployment got edited,right?So if you wantyou can see that rollouthistory one more time.Okay, so maybe I am delayed.So it might have already got completed.Okay, so it already rolled out.So if you see the ports again,all the ports will be terminated and then recreated.See all these are 15 seconds only.Started just 15 secondsbefore our 20 seconds before.So that's a good thing.So now if you see one more observation here,is so one more time you have editedone more Replica set meanslike this is one more deployment.So you are one more replicaset you'll be able to seefor your third version.So let's go ahead and then see thatnow.QCT get RS,right?And CT get ports.So you can verify the hashtag here, right?So, which is nothing,but this is the one current live onewhich is nothing but three two 0 0 versionand 7 7 4 B.And for our ports also you can see 7 7 4 Bas the hash label, right?So that's about it.So now the next thing is rollout history.So let's see that rollout history of our thingand it should be version three,right?So this is the one we have done in version threeand then that is what we are seeing it now.So finally, whenever we access theapplication,right,So we should see version three.Currently it is V2 here andif you want I can make it bigger.Yeah. And if I refresh it should be V3, see, Right?So now the application version is V3.So this complete server,two optionswhatever we have available using the imperative way toupdate our deployments, we have completed.So in our next lecture we are going to focuson roll back deployments.So I'll see you in the next lecture.Until then, bye bye.Thank you.
