13:36
Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to day one of your AWS EKS which is elastic
13:42
kubernetes service session by none other than the world record holder Mr. Emil Daga. Okay. uh but before we proceed
13:49
further okay uh I would like to put across certain norms and conditions the way this session proceeds. So this would
13:56
be a weekend sess session Saturday and Sunday 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. That would
14:02
be your regular training timing. Okay. Uh EKS is been bifocated into two parts.
14:07
One is your basic EKS training and second is your advanced EKS training. So
14:13
currently we'll be starting because it is the day one we'll be starting with your basic EKS session which is starting
14:19
today by none other than again the world record holder the senior principal ID consultant a man who's working towards
14:24
his vision of making India future ready Mr. Daga uh it's always good to know
14:29
about your mentor before you proceed because you'll be uh allocating a lot of time under his guidance. So let me just
14:37
show you a glimpse of who he is, what he has done and you know it will help you
14:43
to know him better. So would like to take more few minutes uh before we proceed further. By the time I'm just
14:48
waiting for the other participants to join it. Uh you can immediately ask all your friends your colleagues who are a
14:55
part of some of the other program where we have given AWS EKS to join the session ASAP. We'll wait for next 2
15:01
minutes and then we'll be starting the session. Thank you so much.
15:59
Okay, before I proceed further, for how many of y'all AWS EKS is the first training under Wimbled's guidance? You
16:07
all can uh share your message in the chat box for my reference. For how many of y'all is it the first training under
16:13
the guidance of Mr. Vimmel Daga Sur to know that that this is your first training under him?
16:20
Okay. Okay.
16:33
Okay. Great. So, there are a few uh for whom this is the first training under Wimbledaga Sur's guidance. Okay. Uh
16:41

16:46
what has he done for the community, what background he comes from, how many years of experience he has, and how does
16:53
industry relate with him because it is very important to know whom are you learning under you're not only investing
17:00
your money but you're investing your time as well. So let me take you a glimpse through who Mr. Viml Gaga is.
17:20
students ignorant average demotivated just in couple of days they have created
17:26
a great things new startup new idea new innovations they have done
17:32
Vimmel Daga the one who is leading the vision of making India
17:38
Future ready is a name very close to the learner's heart. The one who met the
17:44
creators of technology benefited more than 100 plus companies
17:49
with his consultancy and rich industry relevant experience.
17:55
One who got 100 plus global certifications and made it to become the world record
18:02
holder. did everything for the community and changed millions of life. In the last

18:26
[Music]
18:37
[Music]
18:43
[Music] Mr. Daga and that is how he has been
18:49
working day and night to awaken the youth through a culture of right
18:56
education. I want to prove to entire world our engineers,
19:05
our engineers can be the greatest.
19:11
[Music]
19:22
night.
19:39
How many of y'all who know him very well, who has been very with him for a lot of trainings, you know, a lot of
19:46
consultancy or anyway, how many of you all got goosebumps? I do. I do get this
19:52
okay whenever I see this uh video uh because this is how our women sir is
19:57
he's always been there for the community for the society you know uh as much as he can uh has served uh to that level
20:06
that there's no one who works along with these engineering students or professionals or youth you know and who
20:11
says that don't worry we are there with you so and he is one amongst them so thank you so much anyone has any
20:18
management related queries I'm open to take it. Uh the chat box is open in case
20:24
if you have something please share it across.
20:36
Is there any query? If anyone has with respect to the management can please raise their queries in the chat box. I
20:42
would be happy to help.
21:11
Can we get some information about the summer training? I'm sure Rimmels had already done an announcement. Uh in case
21:17
if you need further details, Shubam, you can drop us. Uh the website for the summer is uh the creator.1 that's where
21:25
you can raise your query and the team will be happy to help you. But yes, it is going to be one of in fact it is one
21:31
of the one and only researchbased summer program in the entire world wherein you know so many learners so many
21:38
engineering students from across India they come under one roof they learn they
21:43
research they develop a project and then they present that what they can be or who they are as a creator in just this
21:50
45 days of journey. Yeah, I don't think anyone has more queries. So over to you women sir. Thank
21:57
you so much.
24:02
Hey guys, uh welcome everyone. This is Vimel and um let's continue with this
24:08
very very unique program very very useful program I can say uh service
24:14
called EKS that's called AWS uh EKS services right so um the whole
24:23
idea guys is before I start this program right uh I would like to talk something
24:28
very quick about this uh particular uh because this This training would be
24:37
complete practical or hands-on on EKS right and we'll talk a lot about this
24:43
service right and I'm I'm skipping my introduction part I think pri have introduced me my name will and I believe
24:50
some you guys might have done some other training under me so I'm skipping my introduction part
24:57
like I would like to directly jump to this uh technological product that's called EKS
25:03
okay So uh before we start and go deep into this topic or this service called
25:10
EKS right I would like to tell you one very quick information right that might give you
25:17
uh a reason why we have to be very focused
25:23
and invest proper time on learning this tool or technology.
25:28
Okay. So it is something like this. Uh
25:34
if you guys know about the company name called Netflix. Okay. You know the company name called
25:40
Netflix. So uh the guy who uh
25:47
convinced Netflix why we have to move
25:53
from uh your typical data center what Netflix
25:58
has to the cloud and then to the AWS cloud. So this is a guy Edin his name is
26:04
Adrin he was the person behind or who the main behind the
26:10
Netflix who uh convince right uh the entire uh workload of the
26:18
Netflix to be moved to a cloud that's called AWS cloud right so you think guys
26:24
how much effort or kind of uh P kind of proof
26:32
these guys has done to convert this right so this is one thing right why I'm
26:38
saying this because you know some sometime we have some some who will work
26:46
very proactively they can see what is going to happen in the future how
26:51
company can save the money the cost and many more aspects right and where the Netflix is moving and what they need in
26:58
the future growth and and that is guys if you see the case study of Netflix they're very happy to
27:04
have AWS cloud to running their workload right a similar person guys they also
27:10
see very proactively what is going to happen in the future right these guys again part of CNFC and many more
27:15
communities and what they talk picking up about right they see uh if company
27:22
move to Kubernetes as a tool what benefit they're getting
27:28
in all the ways in the operation cost and many more Okay. And that's what these guys are
27:34
talking about. And if you just talk about Kubernetes, it is not only the Kubernetes. These guys was talking about
27:40
now by chance guys, this this guy Adin is now part of AWS team, right? So some
27:46
some precedent something like what are the post would be okay. They're also talking about a proactive way. If you
27:52
move to the Kubernetes services especially the EK services what benefit
27:59
customer going to have right my point guys here is what I'm trying to tell you right uh the the point here is even this
28:04
article I believe very older uh written on 2018 I believe older article my
28:11
intention is to tell you okay we these
28:16
these people they know what
28:22
future need and if you have take the right decision and move ourself on the
28:28
right technology that will help you to become the pioneer in those those area in the technology
28:37
and uh there's one thing second thing now that what world sees okay in last
28:42
two or three years there's a huge uh adoption of the cubernetes tool and
28:48
technology in this world I'm just You talk about the Kubernetes almost every
28:54
workload company team project they either migrated to the Kubernetes
29:00
or they're migrating it. This is one thing you guys might know and that maybe
29:06
one of the reason why we have a huge demand of Kubernetes for the projects and for the consulting work for the
29:12
training for the jobs. Okay. But in last couple of months I
29:20
have seen uh what I have seen that might not be posted somewhere on the internet
29:25
as such but what I've seen because as a consultant for the corporate guys and as a corporate also we got a lot of
29:32
inquiries okay where to help those top corporates for migration and consulting and
29:40
corporate training of these their team now they are planning or migrating or in
29:45
the marketing fees. Okay. To run the entire workload in the EKS, EKS is a
29:52
service that what we go way deep into uh in this training. uh so there's a lot of
29:58
company might not be listed but because it uh because those query come to us to
30:04
me as a Linux world or from other vendors all right so company like uh
30:10
government sex company known as Apple Netflix might have done already
30:17
they've already moved to AWS but they're running lot of workload in EKS as a service okay Indian government is
30:24
running lots of workload in EKS their services. So 100 example most of the
30:30
thing is not maybe listed most of the uh thing going to announce soon but my
30:36
point here is right there this huge transaction is going on
30:41
okay uh not in kubernetes that is already happened okay it's a tool but I'm talking about
30:49
whoever you are using kubernetes almost everyone is using kubernetes they're migrating moving toward the manage
30:57
services by the AWS that is called EKS. Okay. So whoever would be the early
31:04
adopter of this tool called EKS
31:09
or who were the pioneer or the expert tool they will always run the soup.
31:15
Okay. They will get all the advantages on getting the better job, better projects, hike,
31:22
you know, whatever the way you guys think of in your profile. you get all the benefit right so don't take this
31:28
training that my my my point here is you know why I'm saying this don't take this training just to just to take as a
31:34
learning perspective there's always obviously you want but take this training as a very serious note this is a very very serious tool okay and lots
31:42
of uh companies workload
31:47
real workload top company workload has been completely running not in kubernetes only but they're running on
31:53
the top of EKS service in One of the name you might know if you know a
31:59
company called Amazon.in n or amazon.com you know this is a e-commerce site right
32:05
this is top top product right you you can think of how much workload they have right this is a they have the product
32:13
they have a catalog the entire experience what you see here I believe you guys we
32:20
do lot purching here online e-commerce site from amazon.com right is not a cloud is amazon.com website e-commerce
32:27
right and how we thinking how much
32:32
buying is happening here. How much guys is searching here right? How much I see the project catalogs they check out they
32:40
purchase the shipping right in second in a minute millions of
32:48
customer coming right to this site right and very uh effectively the work is or load has
32:55
been managed right interesting thing is this entire product experience this
33:02
catalog experience this website is running on the top of PKS.
33:08
So this is the one of the great example to see the entire Amazon.com is running
33:14
the entire workload this product catalog experience whatever the word you can see here running on EK. So think guys this
33:22
is a big business right and they need some very stable
33:27
okay and the reliable platform right so it is not only the technology that I know cubernetes I know some concept of
33:34
containers and thing work no we need some platform that is very very stable
33:40
that is a better word to be reliable right it it isn't like this some error
33:45
come up some issues come up some some bug come up and things will fail and slow down right they can't they can't
33:51
compromise in those aspects that's called reliability okay and they this
33:56
company by themselves feel the EKS is very very reliable so why not use EKS
34:03
power okay so I have the entire uh case study of amazon.com
34:11
why they moved to EKS what they had they had a m monic then they moved to micros
34:17
service concept then entire microser This is entire product is based on the micros service architect. Again, this is
34:23
not the micros service training as such. But whoever know the microservices and will know the microservices.
34:29
Okay. Mostly they want their entire setup to be run
34:34
on the kubernetes or here in case EKS. Okay. So this is the entire
34:42
um where it is I have that uh video or
34:47
yeah this one. Okay. So this entire video that this this the top senior engineers
34:56
general manager of this you see here this is where the senior engineer of amazon.com he was
35:02
talking about how they are managing and why they are using EKS
35:09
for running amazon.com e-commerce site and how they are getting the benefited
35:15
of it explain the entire uh structure step by step from the journey from
35:21
monolithic to microservices, what benefit they're getting for EKS and how much cost they save, how much
35:27
reliability they get and many more things right many more things they explain every part over here okay about
35:36
the detail discussion about what EKS provide so point here is my point guys
35:42
here is what I'm trying to tell you okay same thing okay uh same thing
35:49
is um so now we learn how to stop worrying and
35:56
you know make the Amazon not AWS cloud I'm talking about Amazon core at the scale right so we they they feel they
36:03
have no worry any workload come up sudden traffic come up and the biggest
36:08
challenge is you know what when they come up with a lot of uh cell right
36:14
Christmas cell newer cell and something else sudden traffic come up they are not at all worry about uh certain traffic
36:20
come up they know the internal EKS we're going to manage this right so that's how
36:27
I want to start this training to make you and myself also very as a
36:32
serious to learn this tool or technology right but otherwise I I plan this
36:38
training guys in such a way okay because uh because it has been said actually if
36:44
you want to learn EKS then you should have some knowledge of cubernetes beforehand.
36:51
If you don't know the cubernetes, you obviously won't ever to work on EKS. But I I uh make this training in such a way.
36:59
If you guys are new in Kubernetes, even though this is the first time you're hearding this term Kubernetes or hearing
37:05
this term Kubernetes, uh there's no requirement, right? So there's no precision for the Kubernetes.
37:11
That's what I'm trying to tell you here is okay. Whatever the knowledge you need to know about Kubernetes again this is
37:19
not the cubernetes training first of all but whatever knowledge you need to know
37:24
from very basics about the Kubernetes I will explain you here so that the journey of learning this tool the
37:30
training is EKS will be very smooth for you okay smooth for you so that's one thing
37:38
so technically there's no prerequisite for this training you should have very basic knowledge of AWS cloud
37:46
okay means what is EC2 service uh what is EBS and some some very basic thing IM
37:53
okay so if you have basic knowledge of AWS cloud that is the only requirement and prerequisite for this training
38:00
otherwise there's no other prerequisite okay and uh for the cubernetes stand point of
38:06
view you don't need to know anything I'll explain you whatever you need to know to learn this tool called EKS H
38:14
this is one thing. Second thing is uh this training guys divided two part.
38:19
First the basic or the core training and one is the advanced training. Obviously today is the first day we are starting
38:25
with the basic or the core training where I explain you every small word vocabulary and today also uh we will
38:33
launch the EKS services and feel the power of the Kubernetes or the EKS
38:39
and lot more many practical we going to do today but we'll start with the basic concept first okay next thing is this
38:46
training is almost kind of 100% practical whatever the concept I've explained to you uh will create those
38:53
practicals there. Okay. And uh those practical will be mostly around the use cases. I will
39:00
explain the real use cases and to or real challenges. Then I'll show you how
39:06
to solve it practically. So we're going to learn a lot of use cases. We build a project. Uh we do a lot of demos
39:13
practical step by step. Okay. With the uh EKS as a service, right?
39:19
Okay. So that's also we going to do. So prequage is zero. I told you already
39:24
there's no prerequisite. We start from very zero. Only this is what we need. I believe this that level of knowledge you
39:31
already have here. Okay. Or maybe if you don't have the knowledge at least you
39:36
can see and listen what is happening. You will might not be 100% but 90% you
39:41
will get the information right if you don't have the AWS knowledge otherwise you will get 100% from this entire tree.
39:49
Okay. So that's it guys from my side as a very quick set uh for this part agenda
39:56
I as we progress you automatically see uh what we are going to learn otherwise
40:01
whoever is with us in this advanced training they have the agenda we have shared with you what are the content we
40:07
are going to cover in EKS technically almost everything what is ever possible in EKS we going to uh uh see in EKS
40:15
world okay so So let's start guys uh this concept of
40:22
EKS. One more small thing very quickly I want to tell you EKS is a one service in
40:28
AWS. Okay. But this itself a service has a huge potential to perform.
40:36
Okay. And is a manage services of Kubernetes. So if you don't want to manage your own
40:43
Kubernetes or Kubernetes cluster you can ask the Amazon or AWS guys. they
40:48
will manage for you. Okay, the entire management of the Kubernetes cluster is very very painful in many more way what
40:55
I mean by this we will discuss again in some minute. Okay. So, EKS service who
41:01
going to uh manage your cubernetes cluster in the as cloud. Who will
41:08
manage? These guys will manage. We will use it. That's all. Okay. So, that is a very quick
41:14
information otherwise as we progress I will go more deep into this. And fantastic thing is if you know
41:20
Kubernetes, if you know Byson's Kubernetes then in the Kubernetes
41:26
lots of thing we need we need load balancers, we need storage, we need uh
41:33
active directive or authentication and we need uh you know some RAM CPU lot
41:41
many things we need right powerful thing about EKS is EKS is
41:46
tightly connected or integrated to titly means they have highly integrated to
41:52
with AWS services other services. So if you need a load balancer right just by
41:58
running the cubernetes command in the integrated to AWS load balancer called
42:04
ELB or NLP or if you need a storage
42:09
you run the same cubernetes command but until they get the store from EBS volume. Okay. So what I mean by this I
42:16
don't want to right now try to overwhelm you guys those who don't know Kubernetes right but I'm just trying to give you
42:23
very high level overview that that everything has been done already for us we have to just use it only thing we
42:30
have to launch the cluster okay and for the launching the cluster we have a lot of tools available one of
42:36
the very famous tool that AWS recommend that I'm going to use today is called EKSCTL tool is a third party tool but
42:44
has been very famous tool now it's also recommended by AWS also to manage the entire EKS services it's called EKCLE
42:51
tool we'll use so what I said in last 10500 is not much important right now
42:57
you don't understand does not matter we will do step-by-step discussion on it right but before this let me start this
43:05
topic okay a step by step I might need guys around 40 minutes now onward to
43:14
explain you first why and what is Kubernetes
43:19
and lot of vocabulary of Kubernetes I'm going to explain you because till the time you don't know the Kubernetes you can't do much in EKS
43:26
okay so sorry so um
43:34
I need just 40 minutes to explain you what is cubernetes okay and guys again
43:40
one more thing while explaining meaning of the Kubernetes I keep on relating
43:47
this service with AWS also how they integrated AWS what driver they use so
43:55
those who know they think they know Kubernetes don't miss this de discussion here uh because uh I'm also going to
44:02
relate with AWS so when I when I go for the demo we can actually quickly start
44:08
implementing the demo right so two things I'm going to explain bring it together what is
44:13
cubernetes from very zero and same thing to integrated with how
44:20
cubernetes can be indicated with AWS with EKS so what I mean by this in 40 minutes you will get the entire story
44:26
line okay so let's start this discussion from very very zero right
44:33
sorry so so let me start from here that normally we I al always start in this
44:40
way So moto is if you talk about any company they have the customers
44:48
they have the clients okay let me use the better term because client may I might use somewhere else also so they
44:54
have a customer over than maybe internet or network okay and they want to provide
44:59
some customer some services and for this they ask the developer to build the app so they build the app mostly those app
45:06
is known as web app or website and in Java or PHP and Python or Ruby
45:13
whatever the language they use. Okay. Now point is if this company let's say I
45:18
take our name let's say Linux world we develop our app now point is we have to
45:24
run this app for running the app minimum requirement is
45:33
minimum requirement is we need physical hardware this RAM CPU
45:41
okay RAM CPU this go compute services or we need a storage that's called hard
45:47
disk and on the top of this we need operating system maybe Linux or Windows
45:54
let's say Linux operating system and plus we need one more thing we need
46:00
some web server app server or let's say this this program written in uh let's
46:06
say Java or JavaScript maybe so we need interpreter that's also known as runtime
46:13
sometime okay to run this code PHP or JavaScript runtime we need or Java runtime we need okay so these are the
46:21
minimum thing we need right so this thing mostly also known as environment we need this environment
46:27
okay or I can say in my case is we need this kind of OS okay if you don't have this environment you won't able to copy
46:34
your code and run the code here and till the time your code does not run your website does not up and your client
46:40
won't able to uh see your website. M okay now point is okay if you want this
46:49
setup to be up okay then three possibilities we have in
46:56
today's world to have this setup and to run this setup one because this physical hardware and the OS so technically it
47:03
will look like a kind of operating system or I need to run a system and there's three possibility guys to run
47:09
the system in today's world one you guys know bare metal We can run directly on the hardware like
47:15
an like a laptop. One is virtual machines. Okay, we can launch VMware
47:21
virtual machines and Oracle virtual machines and launch there. Okay, or if you know AWS, we can launch
47:28
the virtual machine with a service called EC2. So EC2 will launch a virtual machine. They give a RAM, CPU, hard disk
47:35
to us. They give a OS to us. And after we launch the OS, we will set up or
47:43
configure our runtime. Or if you talk about AWS perspective,
47:48
okay, they also give you some precreated that's called AMIs.
47:53
So if you ask AWS, I need Java runtime. Okay, so they have a pre-created images
48:00
available. There's always image available for Java, for Python, right? Or you can also create yourself. So from
48:07
this image you can launch the entire setup or environment where they give your R and CPU, hard disk, Linux OS or
48:13
Windows OS and some pre uh services configured but EC2 is one way through
48:19
which we can launch this entire environment that is called or system that is called virtual machine but this
48:25
solution is called virtualization setup. Okay third setup that is very very famous in the today's world is container
48:33
concept or containerization technology. Okay, there's also more look like
48:38
virtual machine but the big difference and there's a huge difference I can say but one quick difference is if you
48:43
launch any virtual machine okay when I say launch it means we
48:49
install after install you have to start the OS called boot until the time your OS does
48:54
not install and boot you won't able to run any services your web services your website whatever the term you see you
49:00
won't able to copy your code you won't able to run your code okay So, so to
49:06
launch these are the step you do. We start the OS. So, install the OS, boot the OS, run the services. Okay, it
49:14
depend upon how much time it take depend upon virtualization to virtualization, right? So, we have a lot of virtual tool
49:20
up in the market. But let's say on an average it might take 30 minutes, 2 minutes or 5 minutes depend. Let's say 2
49:26
minutes. Okay. If you launch something on the EC2
49:32
in AWS cloud maybe installing and booting and running some service like
49:38
say web server maybe they launch within a 2 minute but 2 minutes is a big big number right uh in today's competition
49:44
world we can't uh vest 2 minute right we want
49:50
thing to very very quick okay whatever we want to do there role of container
49:56
technology come in play same thing if you want to do in the container that I want to install the OS
50:03
okay then I want to boot the OS then I want to run my services almost same thing whatever you're doing in the VM
50:09
world virtual world like in services can be done with the container technology uh
50:17
within a second or I can say nowadays less than a second mean less than a second your your uh app
50:26
will up okay with the entire RAM CPU
50:31
OS runtime OS application copied to be run within less than of a second.
50:39
Okay, sometime they might take two or five second depend on the app to app but less than second mostly they will up
50:44
right. So point is now we have two choices either we go for virtual
50:49
technology world or we can go for container technological world uh that you have to choose as a company
50:56
standpoint of view what they feel the way we need the today's requirement is
51:02
and I talk about a lot of use case requirement in a minute they they feel today we need agile speed performance
51:10
okay so even though is doing Great job. Maybe
51:16
within 2 minutes everything will be up but we can't wait for 2 minute. I need
51:22
things to be launched in in in 1 second. One of the good example maybe my my
51:28
application is running on instance called EC2 in AWS world. EC2 is
51:34
one service through which we can launch a virtual machine and due to any of the reason this instance failed terminated
51:42
you know got down. Okay. So I can launch one more setup within it two again same
51:49
setup but it might take two minutes but my point is uh in that scenario even
51:54
though this is not the perfect one we have many more thing to be done on the top of this but if you talk just talk
51:59
about this scenario is a quick difference uh in this case if if you
52:05
launch app with EC2 if there's something fail then then client because OS is down
52:12
app is down client customer to wait 2 minutes And this huge waste of the uh of
52:17
the you know I can say this is this this is not a
52:22
good you know you won't get a great feedback from the customer right in 2 minutes how much business you have done
52:28
$1,000,000 you might have wvested right because customer mostly does not might not come again
52:33
please right and does not it does not give you the the good feedback from the
52:39
client also they they feel your site is not reliable okay but In the container world in the
52:45
container in the world if you launch a OS by the way uh if you launch OS in the
52:51
hardware they are known as OS. If you launch the OS in the virtual world they on virtual machine. If you launch the OS
52:56
with a containerized technology then this OS is also known as container. So now onward when I use the word container
53:02
that is equals to operating system or when I say operating system I mean to say
53:09
basic hardware plus OS plus whatever the runtime or server they need to run your app. Okay. So I I keep on using the word
53:16
container maybe now onward. So, so container
53:23
world if something fail destroy does not matter within a second or less than a
53:28
second again launch a new one with same copy. So client does not see any kind of dis disruption uh whatever the case
53:37
would be. Okay. So they say I want a div speed. This is one one very basic example I'm talking about just to give
53:43
you a very quick difference. Other way when we go ahead we'll see many more things. Right. So there's a one quick
53:49
difference right my my point here is I'm trying to tell you that we want the container rises technology and we want
53:57
our OS to be run in the container uh world. Okay. Now point here is if you want to
54:05
launch a container in AWS world they have a service called ECS.
54:11
It's called container services. So ECS is a service in AWS world through which we
54:18
can launch a container. So ECS like in EC2 we have service to launch virtual
54:24
machine. Similarly we have a service called ECS. ECS
54:30
to if you see is a container service. So if you want to launch a container
54:37
okay so we can use this service called ECS. Again this training today is not about ECS. So I'm just giving some name.
54:42
This is what we can use. Okay. But point is launching the container is not the only thing we want.
54:50
Okay. There's many more aspects we want. Right? If you say I have the application, I want to run a container
54:56
or the OS and run my application there. So that if something fail within a second I can launch one more container
55:01
or one more OS. Okay. So uh
55:07
if you have this thing EKS is good maybe they can do many more thing but but it's not the only thing we need. We need many
55:13
more thing on the top of this. What are those things? Right. So let me go ahead
55:18
in this diagram. Okay. Going this. So you know why where I'm moving guys? Right now slowly slowly
55:24
moving toward Kubernetes and then from the cubernet I will move to EKS.
55:30
Okay. Then you will get the entire context why we have to learn EKS.
55:35
Okay. So now it means what we want. Okay. It means what we want uh we want
55:43
our OS to be run on container. So technically it look something like this. If you talk about container world so we
55:49
have some base system this called physical hardware. On the top of this we need one operating
55:55
system. Let's say this is a Linux OS. So in the container world what happen?
56:01
Okay your container will run on the top of the OS. So your container will run over here.
56:07
Okay. And in the top of one OS we can launch multiple container and every container equal to one OS. This OS
56:13
running with a web server. This O running with database server. This O running with the WordPress application whatever you know. But what you need
56:20
minimum between the OS and your your base OS and with your container you need
56:26
one program. Okay. So in the virtual world this
56:32
program is known as hypervisor and in the container world this program is known as engine this called container
56:38
engine. So you need some container engine is a one kind of is a concept name but
56:45
there's a lot of software available in the market who give the container engine
56:50
one of the two famous product in the market who give the container engine to you it is not docker okay so that's
56:57
again the myth in the market docker is the management tool container management tool the engine who actually help you to
57:04
run your containers okay let's say this is container one that equals to OS1 OS2 whatever the term
57:11
you understood here right let's say container 3 okay to run this container you need
57:17
container engine and two famous there may be many more two famous container engine in the uh market is one is cryo
57:26
cryo and one is container D
57:32
okay containerd yeah if you know about docker
57:38
if you know about docker Docker use containerity mostly
57:45
okay mostly containerity but the engine who actually run is like more like a hypervisor in the world of virtual world
57:53
so contain engine either you can use cryo or containerity maybe many more but there are two famous name in the market
58:01
okay so point is if you want to launch a container if you want to launch a
58:06
container okay that is this what I'm highlighting right now here in the red that is equals
58:12
to this entire setup to run your app okay you need container
58:19
engine okay and one technically if you notice here if you notice here this is
58:25
one single system this is one single system okay and this system require physical
58:32
hardware base OS and in this case this OS where container run container like a
58:38
software so This OS is normally known as host OS or the container host.
58:45
Sometime also known as host OS and sometime this OS also known as node
58:51
that's called worker node or compute node. Let me use the word compute node.
58:56
Why? Because this node is the one who is giving you a physical RAM and CPU.
59:02
So that on the top of this my engine run on the engine my my container will run.
59:08
So this OS what I highlighted here entire OS you can think it's like my
59:14
entire windows. So this entire windows if I run my container here okay I can run tens of container here are known as
59:22
compute node or the container node okay till here everything is good but
59:28
challenge come guys and by the way I want to give you one more information here when we slowly move to EKS
59:38
okay so EKS will use the same thing by some better way okay so they use a
59:44
container engine for container D. So EKS right now whatever we going to use I
59:50
should tell you where they use EKS as service we'll start we'll learn soon in
59:55
detail they use containerd not the docker actually directly they use directly the engine called container
1:00:03
because e is the one who going to launch a container for you why and how we'll see but they use containerd as engine
1:00:10
okay again the guys this training is not about the pure container training
1:00:17
So if you have any question that what difference cryon contain I'm not going for this part right now we can get a lot
1:00:22
of document in the market for this okay we our focus will be EKS but I'm just
1:00:27
trying to give you some here and there some information so you can get some idea okay this is what using behind the
1:00:33
scene okay but EKS will talk in very detail okay now in this entire scenario
1:00:41
okay the challenge is if I again draw this diagram one more time very quickly The challenge is if you have one single
1:00:49
operating system, okay, where we have a base OS Linux for example and we have a container engine,
1:00:57
I'm using the word CE now and we're launching a container C1, C2, C3, many more.
1:01:05
Okay. So this container behind the scene is is using the hardware from a base OS.
1:01:15
It's like a sharable. So when this content need 1 GB RAM they take from your base hardware only. So this content
1:01:22
also take from base hardware. This kind of for base hardware. So when you run a content it look like different OS but
1:01:28
behind the scenes share your hardware. You share your base OS also.
1:01:33
Okay. It means in a base computer if you have a RAM memory 4GB.
1:01:41
Okay. So all this container together can use maximum 4 GB. They can't use more than this.
1:01:47
Okay. So so my point is if it means let's say if this content using 1 GB RAM
1:01:55
right now is OS 1 GB RAM for right now. If this country using 2 GB RAM 4 right now entire 4 GB RAM has been exhausted.
1:02:02
There's no memory available. I want to launch one more container. So what can I do? Again we can launch one more system
1:02:09
system here. Okay. With the physical hardware with the OS
1:02:14
again Linux OS. This is also known as host or container host. Again we launch one more container engine here
1:02:21
and we can now this system might have 8 GB RAM for example. Okay. I can launch some container here.
1:02:29
Okay. Let's say container number four. Let's say this guy might require 3 GB RAM they get from here.
1:02:35
Okay. Now again this system also been exhausted. I can launch one more computer, one more comp node, one more
1:02:41
compute node, one more compute node or docker uh docker host or container host
1:02:47
I can say. Okay. The point is it means
1:02:53
it means if you want to launch thousand container
1:02:58
why thousand one for web server second for database may want to want launch 10
1:03:03
website for web server or 10 web server I want to launch or 10 web app I want to launch
1:03:09
okay because we have a huge client and one web server might not able to handle it
1:03:14
okay so finally you know what happened you have You have let me give the name here. This
1:03:20
is computer A. This is server B or node B. Like this you have hundreds of node.
1:03:29
Hundreds of node. Okay. Management of this node is very harder.
1:03:36
Okay. Because if you have lot of node who launching the containers this for
1:03:41
container host also. Okay. The management of these node is very very harder. What I mean by
1:03:47
management? There's many more thing to be managed. One of the simple thing I can tell you right now you can get the
1:03:53
idea what I mean by management. Right? Management means let's say I have one more node here.
1:03:59
Again this node also have a base hardware. Okay. They have the base Linux OS. Again they have a container engine.
1:04:07
But let's say they also running with one container of container five. Okay. Technically if you notice here
1:04:14
this A is individual computer all together actually this is different computer having a different IP maybe
1:04:20
this is a different computer having a different IP maybe okay IP maybe the point here is when I
1:04:28
say about management management would be due to any of the reason this computer
1:04:34
fail terminated network got disconnected
1:04:39
okay in this case this container goes failed because running they are running
1:04:44
on the top of this and it means any application running on this container will fail and my client finally my
1:04:50
customer whoever the customer is for them so for example if we talk about the AWS cloud or Amazon company who has this
1:04:59
website believe me in this website in this website whatever card number you see
1:05:06
here at the top this is the individual application maybe dependent in This page is one
1:05:13
button here. But the the card that you see in the top or the search button you see in the top
1:05:20
there are individual applications running in different different OS.
1:05:26
Okay. And those application most known as microservices but is lo more like applications.
1:05:31
Okay. They're running in individual uh system. Okay. And they if you just
1:05:40
search button here in Amazon this application who help you search okay this application or this search
1:05:46
application is running let's say they're running here
1:05:52
they're running here so this is the search app let's say for
1:05:59
the where they're running in this cont where the running this hardware if this
1:06:04
entire base OS host node whatever what you use here if will fail the search
1:06:09
level goes down in this case okay maybe the entire part of the
1:06:14
application will work the way the architecture this microser architecture again guys for this training you don't
1:06:19
need to know about microser but I'm just keep on using this term here sometime
1:06:25
entire website will work but this part of the Amazon right where you search it will fail it won't work if some they say
1:06:32
it's down down fail not able to connect some message you might get Okay. Now in this case, okay, the role
1:06:40
of operation team in the company or the monitoring team company will come in play. So we have the IT operations guys,
1:06:46
IT ops team or the monitoring team. Now this is your their responsibility to
1:06:53
keep on monitoring this system. What the model are the up are the app
1:06:58
network is done working good OS is working IP. We have uh hundreds of
1:07:05
things they have to monitor. Okay. How? Manually
1:07:11
manually they have to monitor or maybe they give you some tools also to monitor. Okay. And maybe there some come
1:07:18
to know at night 2:00 or 3:00 this system goes down. So what they have to do first they come to know first they
1:07:24
just goes down and we are the human being. It might take some second or some minute to come to know okay something
1:07:29
goes down. Okay. Then whatever the container we launch here we have to run
1:07:36
some command maybe manually. Okay. And to launch this container as a container 4 same one in the different
1:07:43
computer. The point guys here is this process also take a lot of time.
1:07:49
Okay. First of all you come to know then you go to other computer check which system has the RAM available. Okay. RAM
1:07:56
available and then you'll go and launch there. It will again take a lot of time. Okay. And again I was talking about the
1:08:02
agileity speed. A customer does not work for so long. They can't they may try one or two time hit and try in some second
1:08:09
it does not come up. Nobody might not use this application here. Nobody might not use the cart also. Cart is also one
1:08:15
app running in different computer altogether. Okay. They might not purchase from you
1:08:21
that point in time. Okay. So point here is
1:08:26
this is management I'm talking about. There may more thing as we progress I'll talk about it.
1:08:32
Okay. So I I can't give this job to my operation team by somehow they do it. I
1:08:39
don't want to give this responsibility. I want some automation tool some program who will do for me.
1:08:46
Okay. And what we can do instead some human being do for us maybe by some
1:08:51
automation by some other tool but I don't want they will do because they for them it is like a complete process.
1:08:57
Okay. So what can we do? We can launch one more computer here.
1:09:03
Okay. In this computer we run some specialized program. Okay. And the duty of this program main
1:09:10
duty of this program is keep on monitoring this computer, this computer,
1:09:17
this computer. Plus they keep on monitoring this container, this container, this container.
1:09:24
Or as soon as they see one of the entire computer goes down or one of the
1:09:30
container fail, they goes down. Okay. This is a program of human being. A program will run every millisecond.
1:09:38
And as soon as they fail, this goes down. Okay. And this program also can do
1:09:44
one more interesting thing. We can ask this program also keep on monitoring what is the current RAM available? What
1:09:49
is the current RAM available? What is the current RAM available here
1:09:54
and this program is keep on uh knowing this information also this
1:09:59
called realtime information okay information about about in the
1:10:05
system how much RAM is available they up or down all the things okay and as soon as this program come to
1:10:12
know that this particular system goes down okay because they keep on connecting in
1:10:18
real time they keep on checking the status or It's called health on the real time. Okay, they field is down. So what they
1:10:25
do this program also know in this computer this contain running. So what
1:10:30
they do they quickly go to the computer different computer where they know where the RAM is available because they keep
1:10:36
on also fetching the real time from a memory or CPU. They're also known as
1:10:41
metrics. They keep on fetching the real-time metrics. Metric mean RAM CPU memory available or network bandwidth
1:10:47
available. And where they find that resources means
1:10:53
memory CPU is kind of resources where they find resources available they launch this they they go without asking
1:11:00
you as a human being they go and launch the container there and this person will because the beautiful thing of the
1:11:06
container is that's what I was talking about okay if the container fail we can launch a container within a second so
1:11:12
here the power of container will achieve launching this container won't take less less won't take much more than a second
1:11:19
and second thing this programmer also keep on doing this process. So within a second
1:11:26
this container will launch. Now my point is without having any human intervention
1:11:32
if something fail okay or some fault happen
1:11:39
with this program we can able to tolerate the fault
1:11:46
failing this is called fault and they launch again automatically. So it look it it is known as fault tolerance.
1:11:55
So if you want your environment would be setup would be
1:12:01
FT or full tolerance then we need this program
1:12:08
okay and what this program is doing the main role of this program is just to manage the thing is a kind of management
1:12:14
program and what they managing they're managing mainly the containers or
1:12:19
container things so this is kind of container management program and one of the famous example in the
1:12:26
market that is very very reliable. There are a lot of product in the market okay
1:12:32
but there's one famous product in the market that is very reliable in the terms of container sorry cluster not
1:12:39
this is a container management program. So one of the
1:12:45
software that is available in the market who is very reliable on the terms of container management is known as
1:12:50
Kubernetes. So Kubernetes is a container management
1:12:56
program is a software is a program right that
1:13:02
will be run somewhere here in some other computer. I'll talk more about it in a minute who will manage those things. One
1:13:08
of the things they manage many more things they manage. I'm just giving you some very high level overview quickly so
1:13:14
you can understand the some some one of the capability of the of the
1:13:19
cubernetes. So cubain tool otherwise we have a massos marathon we have a docker
1:13:25
uh swam many more we have but cubernet is very very powerful why maybe as we go
1:13:31
progress we'll see it okay so here the role of kubernetes come
1:13:36
in play and the cubernetes world this system
1:13:42
where we run the main program who will do all those things monitoring and something fail to launch again okay this
1:13:49
system is is the main system in the Kubernetes world. This system is mostly
1:13:54
known as manager computer because they're managing it because this entire
1:14:00
computer having the OS and RAM and program will run. Okay. So this is the manager computer and also it is known as
1:14:07
node. Every computer also known as node. So this called manager node. So this called kubernetes manager node. Okay.
1:14:14
And what what they managing? They're managing these computer. These are the computers where we run our final container or the app or any computer
1:14:22
where we running our app or the container because they're working for us. So they are known mostly known as
1:14:27
worker node. Worker node. So finally if I create a very quick clean diagram so it will look
1:14:34
like this. In the kubernetes world we have very important system. Okay are
1:14:40
known as manager. sometime as also known as master or manager whatever name you
1:14:45
can give here computer is called node okay and we have they have to manage lot
1:14:54
of different different computers okay independent computers uh this
1:15:00
called node are known as worker node sometime they work also known as slave node sometime they also known as compute
1:15:05
node multiple name they have whatever you want to use node okay so listen is a node node A. This is
1:15:12
node B. This is node C.
1:15:18
So they are managing these guys.
1:15:23
Okay. Who is managing some program? So in this program the program name is called Kubernetes. So cubern guys also
1:15:30
sometime write a cube or sometime also we write K8s is short form. So
1:15:35
cubernetes manager node is one program we installed somewhere here.
1:15:41
Okay, technically um these are the individual computers having their own
1:15:46
RAM, CPU, OS and the software. So let me give a IP address also just for reference. This IP plus IP 100, this IP
1:15:52
1, this IP 2, this IP3 okay this one point. Now, now next point
1:15:59
here is okay, next point here is u if you talk
1:16:05
about the Kubernetes, if you talk about this computer, let me draw this to a little bit bigger in
1:16:10
diagram. This computer having the IP. So when I say when I say IP00 is my
1:16:17
manager computer. So manager is managing a lot of thing. Okay. Right. Right now what I explained
1:16:23
to you here is explain to you here is they launch a container here
1:16:31
it means they are running one program internally so there's one program
1:16:36
they're running inside this computer this called kubernetes program their duty is whenever they want to launch a
1:16:43
container on IP 1 or IP 2 IP3 they will somehow find out which is the best
1:16:50
computer launch obviously one of the things they check the metrics. Metric means they say okay IP3 has a uh has
1:16:56
some RAM okay but RAM is a lot of RAM is free so let's go to IP3 and launch there
1:17:03
okay so they launch uh the container that is called oper system that is called app over here
1:17:11
okay so in this measure there's some kind smart or intelligent program who have this intelligence to decide where
1:17:18
to launch that program is known as cellular this known is cube scheduleuler is the name of the program. cube
1:17:25
scheduleuler. This is the duty of this program to uh take this decision and
1:17:31
schedule means launch uh to one of the things. Okay. Like this there's many
1:17:36
more program. So one big computer running with lots of program. Every program in this computer has some other
1:17:43
responsibility. Okay. One program they're running here is is something like this. So I want to
1:17:51
give you one more vocabulary here guys. Now in this case IP 100 1 2 3 these are
1:17:56
independent computers but they work together as a team to to manage the containers or manage
1:18:03
the operating systems and in this case this team is kn technically known as cluster. So
1:18:10
technically this setup that you see here this box this setup is known as cluster
1:18:18
and typically because there we are managing the cluster for the container because we can create a cluster for
1:18:23
storage also. We can create a cluster for uh for computing also but this
1:18:29
cluster is meant for container. So this is called container cluster and who
1:18:36
create this container cluster a software called kubernetes it's called kubernetes
1:18:42
container cluster so cluster is term we use here
1:18:47
okay but who going to use this cluster okay some of our team intern team this
1:18:53
cluster is not for example if I ask we are the customer of Amazon right if I
1:18:58
ask my card is one application
1:19:03
Okay. And where the application running? This application guy is running in this container.
1:19:10
In this container which which application card application again this is a this is a uh service
1:19:20
again one more thing I want to tell you. I don't want to go to microser world but if you see this Amazon website on
1:19:26
Netflix it look like one single website. It look like one single big app but it
1:19:31
is not. Okay. They they create this kind of look and feel that is called view.
1:19:37
Okay. But internally there lots of reasons.
1:19:42
Okay. What they have done? What are reasons? I will talk later some of the reason in the future in this training
1:19:49
but internally okay this entire
1:19:54
uh code that will help you and give this capability of of searching capability of
1:20:02
order capability of card capability of showing maybe this product list here
1:20:10
internally they are running they have a different code for this This is the
1:20:15
different app all together web app and this app they're running on the top of different OS and computer all together.
1:20:24
Okay. In this in our world this app will do only searching. This app will do
1:20:30
card. This app will do order. Okay. Or shipping or many more things. So in this world we normally use this
1:20:37
term instead of app we give the name called micros service. Micros service.
1:20:43
Okay. But mechan you can use the word app also. Okay. So whoever create this website
1:20:50
here this go front end this also known as view. Okay they get some data from
1:20:56
this app they get some data from this app from this app and collect together and get one single view. So it look like
1:21:01
one single website but no it is uh multiple different different
1:21:07
um uh app running behind the scene in different different OS. And this OS
1:21:13
maybe can run as a container. So the card is running in the C1 container or
1:21:19
or maybe uh search running in the C2 container,
1:21:25
search app or search micros service. Okay. But we are not the one as a
1:21:30
customer. We are not the one who going to launch card and search. We use it. Who will launch this container or this
1:21:37
application? some of my team, my technology or IT team maybe. So this
1:21:43
team will sit in their area in the cubicle in the cabin in their working
1:21:48
area from the system. Okay, for the system what they do they
1:21:54
connect to this computer. Okay. So this is your some of your IT
1:21:59
team and depend who is managed your devops team whatever you say you can say here they will contact to your master
1:22:07
computer on IPU and say and say now I am not going to handle my
1:22:14
computers okay for example the way I explained to you here I'm not going to handle this
1:22:21
physical hardware or the Linux and the container because it is not one single
1:22:27
computer there's a hundreds of computer here right A B C D hundreds and I don't know which computer has how
1:22:34
much RAM available free I have no idea so as IT team whatever I need that I
1:22:42
know what I want I know but but whatever app I want to launch I
1:22:50
know but I don't know where to launch because you
1:22:55
have IP 1 IP 2 IP 3 and maybe hundreds of computers we have or work on node we have.
1:23:01
Okay. So this responsibility you handle why because
1:23:08
you keep on internally collecting the information.
1:23:13
Okay. And that information means that you keep on collecting the information about how many node we have, how much
1:23:20
RAM and CPU they have this point in time, how many container they're running in IP1 that point in time. Okay, this is
1:23:28
called the state of the cluster. So you are the one who collecting the
1:23:34
state and obviously guys state is like an information. So again in the master
1:23:40
node they also running one more program that is storing the information about the clusters called street information
1:23:48
and for this in cuber there's very very famous product kind of database
1:23:53
that is known as HCD etc. at CD is a one kind of database.
1:24:00
So in this IP 100 okay this is the one of the program they're running this is the one of the
1:24:07
program they're running everybody has different thing so they say you know you
1:24:12
are collecting this information somehow okay and storing in database HD in your
1:24:18
system you know what is the current state or status of your uh cluster right
1:24:24
now I don't know and I don't want to know now I want to give you this entire
1:24:30
management to you my my requirement is maybe in the future I want to launch one
1:24:36
more app that's called order app so I am giving this requirement to or is
1:24:44
a kind of request I want to launch a app or a micros service whatever whatever you see say
1:24:50
here is called order okay don't be confused with this term
1:24:57
that is only one written line here but behind the scene this huge program is running or app is running here behind it
1:25:05
this go back end okay so you just request as it team then your manager
1:25:13
will automatically go and find as a find okay I according to my scheduleuler computer 2 is free somehow so let me
1:25:20
launch this content as a content number three that is actually order app
1:25:28
who will do this guy will Okay. So technically in this context the
1:25:35
IT team is the one who are using the Kubernetes master or the cubernetes
1:25:40
cluster. So they are normally known as user of the cubernetes. Sometimes also known as client.
1:25:46
Okay. So they are the Kubernetes client who the IT team in the company. They say they whatever they they want that only
1:25:54
contact manager node and they will launch for them. This is how they work.
1:25:59
Okay. And now after the launch there's no there's no headache I can say uh to
1:26:05
be there in the mind of IT team now because we know it has been launched by Kubernetes they keep on monitoring this
1:26:13
they keep on monitoring this means means if somehow this container feel
1:26:21
disconnected entire node fail disconnected they automatically reschedule it in the different node This
1:26:28
fold tolerance is a core facility by the Kubernetes.
1:26:34
Okay, there are other container clustering tool also like docker swam but I'm talking about kubernetes there's
1:26:39
a core facility they give you if something fail they relaunch it for you.
1:26:46
Okay. So for the final customer perspective, customer means Okay. Let me draw here.
1:26:52
The customer means uh let me draw here. So we have some customer over the internet.
1:26:58
In my case, imagine perspective. I am the customer. We are the customer. So when we use this M1 and this one. So
1:27:04
finally somehow we are lending we are connecting to
1:27:11
to this container. This is a container where app is running. cart is running or this app where order is running.
1:27:20
Okay. So the customer perspective all right if something fail they don't have
1:27:25
to worry about now the IT team the customer your your manager will
1:27:31
automatically connect and launch this order app here
1:27:38
order app here. Okay. And they do some kind of magical thing behind this here. Okay. Initially
1:27:46
customer was hitting to this computer but automatically customer without knowing anything they automatically
1:27:53
start connecting this order. So they see no downtime as such. They
1:27:58
see there's no disruption as such. Okay. And seamlessly they connect to the
1:28:05
container or the or whatever wherever they're running is. So two thing you achieve here. One is full tolerance. How
1:28:12
automatically if something fault happen they launch it. And second thing is they give us seamless uh facility
1:28:22
because customer till now was hitting to order app on node B the different come
1:28:29
different IP address right but as soon this entire system goes down
1:28:34
customer doesn't have to not have to don't have to change any IP address and there's no connection change
1:28:40
automatically they connect to this system or node A seamlessly without
1:28:47
doing any changes. Okay. How is possible? Again, Kubernetes give this facility. They have one
1:28:53
program who help this kind of context what I'm talking about right now. We're running
1:28:59
somewhere where somewhere I'll show you in some minute when I launch the cluster. But that name that program who
1:29:05
give this seamless experience okay to connect the here and automatically here without any changes
1:29:12
then it's called cube proxy is one program given by the cuber where they
1:29:18
run we'll discuss I'm just trying to give some vocabulary here
1:29:23
okay so uh customer feel uh see the seamless uh thing okay one more thing I
1:29:30
want to add for the IT team perspective for the IT team perspective
1:29:36
uh perspective when they connect to the master they also have to connect some
1:29:42
program right so in the master there's one more program running that program is dedicated for my IT team or the user or
1:29:48
the or the IT client you can say here okay this program again running in this
1:29:53
master computer only and name of this program I'm writing here is called API program it's called cube API program.
1:30:02
So this program is specially meant for the IT team IT. So they can come to this
1:30:10
program and after this program uh they will send the request.
1:30:17
Okay, they will send the request and on based request the particular app will be launched. App means they will launch the
1:30:24
app inside the container. One more word I want to give here uh you here in the container technology world.
1:30:32
Okay. The container is known as container. The container container.
1:30:39
Same container has been launched by Kubernetes but in the Kubernetes world we don't use
1:30:46
the word container as such. We have we use a normal different vocabulary.
1:30:51
Instead of container we normally give a word here or vocabulary here is called port.
1:30:59
So now onward when I say port it is almost equals to container there some
1:31:04
small minor difference maybe we might talk about in the future but let's say it's almost equals to
1:31:09
container and you guys know container is almost equals to operating system when I
1:31:15
say operating system it can physical hardware OS plus the application running over here right that was the meaning of
1:31:23
the port but in the cubernetes world we don't use the word we are launching the
1:31:29
container. Okay, technically we use the word that we are launching the port. Okay, that's
1:31:36
what uh we uh use here. Okay. So this is the information guys is enough
1:31:42
right now there's there's many more facility cubernetes will provide but I
1:31:48
told you guys this training is not about cubernetes okay even though we have a dedicated
1:31:53
course ck ck dedicated for some two months and some big program only on
1:32:00
cubernetes we have but I'm just trying to give you only those vocabulary or minimum
1:32:05
vocabulary that you can quick start our journey with EKS. Our main topic is EKS. I'm
1:32:12
trying to give you a minimum vocabulary so you can start the thing. Okay, that's what we have done already.
1:32:19
Okay, but when we start using EKS and I'll show you a lot of demo of Kubernetes there. Then many more
1:32:26
concepts going to come up, vocabulary going to come up as we progress. I keep on giving those information to you. But
1:32:32
this much information right now is more more than enough to start with the AKS. So till now what I explained to you I
1:32:40
explained to you a software or a program this itself a very famous
1:32:46
program in the market called cubernetes. This is the program I was talking about.
1:32:54
Okay. And this software you can also download from here and use it. Okay. Now
1:33:00
point is even though if you see here Google also build their workload in in kubernetes
1:33:07
even though this product start from Google only almost every company use cubernetes so that is we have a huge
1:33:13
demand in the market for cubernetes right the point here is finally
1:33:19
okay is now this is what the cubernet is doing and cubet is itself a software is
1:33:27
a free software opensource software you can download it, you can install it.
1:33:34
Okay, you can use it. Can you do everything what I explained to you right now? Where in your own
1:33:41
personal computers in your laptop? Yes, in this computer I can install the manager node, worker node, all the
1:33:48
things we can do in this computer, right? In my own desktop computer, my own server.
1:33:54
Okay, everything we can do by ourself. The point is that what is EKS then? So
1:34:00
EKS is a one service from AWS cloud, Amazon cloud. Okay. Now what is
1:34:09
the role of EKS? Okay. To understand the role of EKS, let
1:34:14
me again draw a cubernetes cluster then you can I can explain you the role of
1:34:20
role of um EKS. Okay. So and one thing guys the minimum
1:34:26
requirement we need in the kubernetes is we need a master computer or master
1:34:32
node. This is the intelligent brain behind the kubernetes
1:34:38
and technically this computer is OS means we need some
1:34:44
physical hardware is hardware network card RAM CPU many more thing plus we need operating system
1:34:52
maybe Linux or some some other Linux and plus
1:34:58
here we need to run lot of programs which program I have given you some of
1:35:04
the list cube set program at CD program
1:35:09
cube API program many more but let's say to make it simple we have to run cubernetes program here to make it
1:35:15
simple okay and this computer obviously is a
1:35:21
computer this having IP address let's say IP 100 let me write here
1:35:27
okay write here this is the minimum requirement the cubernetes
1:35:32
Okay, then we can say we have a Kubernetes with us. After you having this then your IT team from their system
1:35:39
can use it. They become a user of Kubernetes. They will go and use this computer by 32 IP.
1:35:47
Okay, this minimum requirement. Now one more requirement we have that what of this when they say that I want to launch
1:35:54
a app then the master node will go to the
1:36:00
worker node somewhere here let's say an IP one this also node but this a worker
1:36:06
node or the compute node again again guys when I say worker node
1:36:12
computer again same thing they also have physical hardware they have again some operating system again they run some
1:36:18
kind program one of the main program in the worker node. I told you already worker node means we have to run some
1:36:26
container engine. Okay. So we have to run some container
1:36:31
as a minimum requirement. Okay. This what we need. Then only
1:36:39
your master node will go here and say uh
1:36:44
to this container engine that my user require app to be launched. So I want to run this app. I want to run the app as a
1:36:52
container that is called port here. I want to run the port. Port is equal to container. Container equal to like one
1:36:57
app or OS. Okay. Now in this entire even the
1:37:03
similarly we have many more many more node node number two n three
1:37:08
and many more. Okay now challenge here is okay if you
1:37:15
want to launch anything right you need minimum physical
1:37:21
hardware. So if you try to create a list
1:37:27
minimum you need physical hardware. Okay. From where you get the physical
1:37:34
hardware either you purchase by yourself in your own data center but you guys
1:37:39
know the concept called on demand. Maybe purchase a huge amount investment but we
1:37:44
don't need so much the amount will wester right. So this is we want this physical hardware will be come on demand
1:37:53
and you guys know when you want should say on demand it means we're talking talk about cloud right
1:38:00
okay so here one of the role of AWS cloud would be they say I will give this physical hardware to you
1:38:07
this physical hardware I will give to you okay so this AW say I will take this
1:38:14
responsibility okay even So I will take this responsibility to give this physical
1:38:20
hardware. You guys know if you want to take a physical hardware you can use EC2
1:38:25
service they give to you. Then talk about the operating system let's say Linux
1:38:32
okay again installing the Linux is not important guys understand one thing we are going to launch application for the
1:38:38
production environment right we keep on checking the OS any vulnerabilities
1:38:46
security vulnerabilities patches update there's maintenance we have to keep on doing
1:38:52
okay if you are install this OS by yourself you have to manage everything
1:38:59
by yourself as a go maintenance it's not small task okay and because mostly if you do
1:39:04
maintain some of the case you have to shut down your OS then do something and then start it will be downtime we don't
1:39:10
want any downtime because my customer is connected already okay so Amazon say we have some way
1:39:17
okay whenever you want to manage your operating system there's maintenance
1:39:22
patches upgrade upgrade whatever you say here Okay, give this responsibility to us.
1:39:29
I will take this responsibility and we have some smart way. Okay, that we keep on maintaining you to
1:39:36
update. We have the big powerful team for security and Linux knowledge everything we have. So we'll update the
1:39:41
le best thing whatever best updates we can possible patches security vulnerabilities
1:39:47
okay what is keep on coming in the market we're very active in it plus we'll update in such a way there will no
1:39:52
downtime you never realize I will do for you behind the scene so when you want to update anything about OS
1:39:59
here or maybe here okay we will do for you and in a way
1:40:06
there will be no no down you never realize neither You hit your performance, your customer connecting
1:40:12
your app, they may never realize but update is happen behind the scene. Okay, will do for you.
1:40:19
Second thing is if you know about the programs, this also software, right? The software is also keep on updating the version keep on changing.
1:40:26
So any program running in the master node or the worker node like a container engine.
1:40:32
Okay. So any program or maybe you can use the word services
1:40:38
if you want to do any kind of maintenance maintenance upgrade whatever you see
1:40:43
here I will do for you who will say I will take this responsibility
1:40:49
to do okay rather you do we will manage for you so technically if you working in one
1:40:57
company let's say Netflix and Amazon.com okay so Amazon.com also user of this
1:41:04
cluster their developer their IT team they are free from these activity these are known
1:41:11
as operational activity they are free from it okay this one small thing guys huge time
1:41:18
will take huge uh intelligence it take means the the
1:41:24
competence professional in a company you need okay but let's say you are one
1:41:29
company you have different product all together right you don't need anyone who knows
1:41:35
security and Linux and maintenance all the things right why we invest a lot of money and time there let's do for you so
1:41:43
they say I will do this thing for you so technically in AWS world if they are managing everything for you so that is
1:41:49
called managed so they say we manage this service for you
1:41:55
and this is in this in this case which service they are managing they're managing whatever you need to do in the
1:42:01
terms of management of Kubernetes they will do for you. So they are giving you a managed service
1:42:07
for Kubernetes. Whatever they need you need to know and do about Kubernetes they will do for you. This all some
1:42:14
information I'm giving to you. There many more thing they manage for you. I'll just keep on giving the list in a minute.
1:42:19
Okay. So as a user of the Kubernetes and IT team of XYZ company let's work world
1:42:25
IT team. We don't have to worry anything about the hardware resources, network,
1:42:30
network bandwidth. Okay. Many more things also. Okay.
1:42:36
Everything is managed completely by AWS. And here they launch a service that
1:42:43
is called EKS service. Elastic cubernetes service is a Kubernetes
1:42:49
service but it is a managed service by AWS where they are taking these responses. they
1:42:55
have many more responsibility also. Okay. They say they say if more requests
1:43:02
come from IT team to to launch here and there on the fly I does not impact the
1:43:08
performance. I will increase the resource RAM and CPU. You don't know feel any downtime.
1:43:16
Okay. Suddenly more requests come from the client the network. I will increase
1:43:23
the network bandwidth on the fly. Okay. And there's a possibility guys in
1:43:29
this cluster. Okay. There's a master. If I draw this diagram very quickly here, there's a master. This is slave. Slave.
1:43:36
Slave. This is what the cluster we have. There's a manager and there's a slave or
1:43:41
master slave. This master slave relationship in this world. If master
1:43:47
goes down, so most of the things will fail. Does not work. Again in this case we can use this term
1:43:55
called single point of failure. If master fail okay nobody care but going to master
1:44:02
without master they we can't manage further things. Okay so master is a very commonly single
1:44:08
point of failure. Master fails entire setup will fail might not work properly. Okay so that is guys what we normally
1:44:16
need. We need one more thing, right? Instead, what can we do? Instead, we run
1:44:21
one master, we can launch one more master. We can launch one more master in individual
1:44:28
computers. This is IP 100, this IP 200, this IP 205 for example.
1:44:35
Okay, everybody is a master handling the same cluster, same node.
1:44:41
Okay. So if IP is handling due to some reason if IP00 fail or anything happen
1:44:49
this hardware right OS program it will fail without knowing anything automatically
1:44:55
this master will take care or this master will take care they will handle handle the main part seamlessly again.
1:45:04
Okay. So normally in the cluster world we also want master to be have multiple copy and by this
1:45:12
okay and any of the reason if master fail or unavailable second available this concept is called high availability
1:45:20
okay so can we set up high availability by the software Kubernetes in our own laptop in our own premises complete data
1:45:27
center yes but we have to manage it we have to configure it take a lot of intelligence again for
1:45:34
competence I can say here. Okay. But AWSA
1:45:41
okay whatever the uh cluster you we will create for you with this service code
1:45:47
EKS you don't worry about the master we are creating the master
1:45:53
for HA only hire everybody only okay dur any of the cases if the master
1:46:00
fail who can buy us okay you won't see any disruption in your services uh
1:46:08
automatically my second M third M will take care of this part. So any issue of
1:46:13
certain traffic come up network increased means traffic increase something fail hardware fail everything
1:46:20
we they will take care in any in in all the way okay who will do is completely
1:46:27
managed by EKS made by EKS okay you don't have to
1:46:33
manage anything almost whatever the cubers need they will do I'm talking
1:46:38
about for cluster management perspective How you want to use that will be your lookout because obviously they does not
1:46:45
know what application to launch right they give you a pre- setup cluster preset means the set cluster what we ask
1:46:52
them they will set up for us okay but how want to use that would be
1:46:57
your IT team which app they want to launch they can launch which port they want to launch they can launch
1:47:03
okay yeah what cubern give you that capability the kubernetes give to you
1:47:08
say if port fail I will launch for So my capability is there but on the top
1:47:14
of Kubernetes what AWS also giving you okay they say
1:47:19
Kubernetes a big huge cluster if you set up your own cluster you can
1:47:25
do if you know Kubernetes by the open source tool and this kind of tool opensource product is sometime also
1:47:32
known as vanilla vanilla product. So if you want to use vanilla kubernetes you
1:47:37
can use if you want to use but you have to manage everything you can we will get the kubernetes power the way I explained
1:47:43
to you but management will be your headache investment would be a headache of your
1:47:50
hardware and everything okay but here I would like to take the entire responsibility on my shoulder
1:47:58
that's what is talking about and here the role of EKS service come in play so
1:48:04
EKS is equals to entire Kubernetes plus
1:48:10
the management or maintenance of the Kubernetes.
1:48:15
Okay. Okay. And this mental management of Kubernetes means the setting up also and setup means the setting up with the
1:48:23
with the uh the best practices what we need in the terms of performance in terms of best practices security
1:48:31
reliability availability. Okay. everything as a best practices.
1:48:37
Okay, they can give you and that is the reason if you talk about any company their product whatever they launch
1:48:43
they're very serious right for example and Netflix want to launch a product for the app it's not about that just want to
1:48:50
keep they want thing to be very very reliable it does not goes down very very
1:48:56
available something fail automatically second will start they want full tolerance they want they want aability
1:49:04
reliability right security. Okay. If they think this platform now is
1:49:10
very much production ready, mission critical platform kind of thing is ready
1:49:16
then they can use this product right and EK is what this is what EK is giving you a security okay because the all the
1:49:23
power of Kubernetes all the power knowledge of AWS guys pluck together and they come up this things this is most
1:49:30
trusted way that's what they claim here most trusted way to use the Kubernetes
1:49:35
by service called EKS service Amazon Okay, that's what they are claiming here
1:49:43
and uh that is a reason if you see the customers in this website. Okay, you can see some list of the customer who are
1:49:50
mission critical are they launch relative security scalability scalability we'll discuss in a minute what I mean by this snap and babyon
1:49:59
there's a case study SSB bank they have huge case study here why they using EKS
1:50:05
amazon.com that's what I was talking about and you guys get the video what I was watch video playing is come from
1:50:10
this link only this video about the entire uh benefit or the case study Plus
1:50:17
the architecture how they using in amazon.com you can get from here many more customer you can find here lot of
1:50:24
customer name does not listed here okay for example Indian government running
1:50:30
their lot of app on the top of EKS
1:50:36
cluster only a lot of company that is under migration in this month this this
1:50:42
quarter might not be listed here but huge list of company that I'm giving
1:50:48
consulting my non are giving consulting training so huge uh thing is changing in
1:50:54
this world of EKS okay so this is one thing guys um uh now
1:51:01
I want to give you some more vocabulary there's many more thing to be add on the cubernetes and the EKS but I think now a
1:51:09
lot of talk happened right I think let's do some demos practicals
1:51:14
uh and as we progress in this training Okay. As and when the thing requirement come up, I keep on explaining those
1:51:22
uh those concept and vocabulary to you. Okay. Especially about EKS mainly uh
1:51:30
what responsibility they take. Okay. They managing everything
1:51:36
master worker or they only managing master we'll talk about it. Okay. and
1:51:42
and sometime I'll explain you no they are only managing the master the most critical unit worker node you have to
1:51:48
manage but they have one more service integrated with the a EKS called Fargate
1:51:55
this called serverless so upcoming disc advanced discussion of EKS we'll talk about fargate also we
1:52:02
talk about carpenter also there's one interesting service they added many more things we'll we'll see in the future uh
1:52:09
to make it this service more more optimized right so right now that's not a part right now but in the ek advance
1:52:17
we'll talk about far get carpent and many more things okay by step by step we'll we'll we'll start this journey
1:52:23
right so right now this information is enough to quickly start and guys I we
1:52:28
explained to you I start from way zero if you notice here okay and what information you need to know
1:52:36
about kubernetes and containers I explain to you one more small thing in
1:52:42
EKS if you are what EKS will do finally it helping you to launch and set up the
1:52:48
entire cubernetes cluster. This was the final one summary of EKS.
1:52:54
So in the EKS they are the one who going to launch worker node also and worker node we need a container engine
1:53:01
and I told you guys there are a lot of container engine is there in the market but they are using container D
1:53:07
not the cryo Okay, not the one thing if you guys know
1:53:13
rocket or docker or podman they are not the engine they are just a management
1:53:18
tool I'm talking the engine like a hypervisor like engine they are the one
1:53:23
who launch helping to launch your container or the port so in the EKS
1:53:30
world they the engine they are using is containerd not the cryo they are two
1:53:35
famous one in the market they using containerd I'm talking about EKS
1:53:41
Okay. But cubernetes service is given by Azure
1:53:46
cloud also, Google cloud also and other products also there in the market who
1:53:52
give cubernetes service like open sift they might use different engine
1:53:57
is there their preference choice and whatever the way they are managing but everyone have a different choice but
1:54:03
here I'm talking about EKS they using container D. Okay. So let's start guys
1:54:08
with the demonstration of EKS think right. So our plan is guys to
1:54:17
launch the EKS cluster and to launch the EK cluster there's multiple way.
1:54:24
Okay. So what I'm doing right now guys let me stop sharing screen for a minute. I'm doing nothing. I'm just trying to
1:54:31
log to my AWS cloud account here.
1:54:38
Okay. And uh then I believe obviously you can
1:54:43
have your own account to do this demos if you want to
1:54:50
do. Okay. So let me log into one of my account format please
1:54:57
because there lot of uh independent training is going on parallel. So I have
1:55:03
using multiple account for different different purpose. So let me take find
1:55:09
out my credential for this training. One minute guys. Uh login here.
1:55:16
Come on account and then I'll show you how to use it. I
1:55:23
also talk about the the about this service pricing
1:55:29
in a minute. Okay, but let me log in. So guys, I I
1:55:35
need 15 20 more minute to the next part or to explain the next part and then I
1:55:42
open the Q&A. So if you have any questions to be asked till now what I
1:55:48
explained to you, you guys can ask me. But let me just give you some more information before we go ahead.
1:55:56
Okay. So
1:56:04
okay. Okay.
1:56:09
So this is the account I have login with. Okay. And guys I'm right I right
1:56:15
now working in the Mumbai region. This is a regional services in the Mumbai
1:56:20
region. If you search for EKS, this is one cubernet service we have.
1:56:27
Okay. And uh what we are going to do, we are going to launch a Kubernetes. This
1:56:33
is a fully managed Kubernetes service.
1:56:39
Okay. And one more vocabulary I want to give you. Okay. In the manager computer,
1:56:46
they are running lot of independent programs. The way I given to you the name uh again it's not required to know
1:56:53
the name if you don't understand the name but I try to give you very quick vocabulary cellular API so these are
1:57:00
individual program running in one computer only or indiv service running on one computer only this called master
1:57:07
okay but they're controlling the entire cluster so any computer entire computer running
1:57:15
with multiple program are controlling the entire That's something or here this case cluster mostly we give a fancy name
1:57:23
in the market it's called control they are controlling it it's called control plane there's a plane to which we're
1:57:30
controlling this thing whatever we are working on it's just a name there's nothing technical meaning about it meaning about
1:57:37
it it's just a fancy name we use just to just to speak right so that's
1:57:43
what they're talking about control plane so they are going to manage the entire cubernet control plane It means they're
1:57:49
talking about they're going to control fully control okay your entire master
1:57:55
computer okay you don't have to worry anything some of the list I given to you already
1:58:01
but many more thing they will do for you okay you to just create a cluster and
1:58:07
this first time when you see this okay you see this this is what you can see this may be some kind of diagram they
1:58:13
show you uh but there's no cluster here we can go and create the cluster so click and create the cluster.
1:58:20
Okay, before I create the cluster, I want to tell you little bit about uh
1:58:27
about pricing. Okay, so this service is not free.
1:58:35
Okay, I'm talking about the control plane. Control plane is equals to master node. Forget we'll talk in the future.
1:58:42
But two things you know already. Control plane that is equals to master node. either your one master, 10 master, two
1:58:48
master, three master and worker node is worker node like slave node.
1:58:53
Okay. So right now talking about the control plane before this very small
1:58:59
information I want to give you so you can understand this context. Okay. AWS say
1:59:07
give this responsibility to me this master node.
1:59:13
Okay. in this node. How much RAM I give, how much network bandwidth I give, how
1:59:20
much CPU I put, which OS I use, everything I will manage.
1:59:27
So management of the master node is internal to me. Where I put, which team
1:59:32
will manage it, everything I will manage for you. And that is reason they use this term here in the first page.
1:59:40
Control plane is fully managed. So this master node is equals to control
1:59:46
plane that you don't have to worry about even though when you launch the cluster
1:59:54
and you want to see where this master is how it look and feel how to login what is there inside you can't see
2:00:02
Amazon will launch for you dedicated for is not shared it's dedicated master control node they launch for you
2:00:10
okay but they won't show you you won't see in your account. Okay. But they give you in the secure
2:00:17
way that only your account can use it. Nobody can able to use this. Okay. Why? Because they say this fully
2:00:24
managed or anything that is fully managed by AWS. We don't we know where to see it
2:00:32
but we can use it that we can use one more term here that's called serverless.
2:00:38
Okay. So either you can use the word fully managed or the serverless. It is same thing. Okay. So, uh for the master
2:00:46
node perspective, they're giving you a serverless experience.
2:00:52
Server doesn't mean they server. Server they have but they are not showing you they are doing everything behind the scene for you.
2:00:59
Okay. And because they're giving this facility everything they managed behind the scenes. So they have some pricing
2:01:04
folders. I'm talking about manager or master node. They have some pricing folders.
2:01:11
And how much the price? I think it's not free in free tier. Okay. They giving you having a price of I think not much
2:01:18
actually 0.010 per hour.
2:01:26
Okay. So this entire setup giving RAM CPU network bandwidth management update
2:01:31
patches all thing whatever they're doing h a high aability they're charging you
2:01:37
0.10 10 uh cents mean 10 cents they're charging or 0.1 1.0 0 they're charging
2:01:43
maybe you can see over here so go to control pane pricing
2:01:50
okay that's much they charging here so 010
2:01:56
per hour EKS cluster management okay means providing this helping you to
2:02:03
launch even the helping of the cluster launching also and whatever you need in the control plane they give you in this
2:02:10
price. So according to me when also check in free tier also I don't think it's free but this is my charge. It
2:02:18
means if if you want to just see this training of mine just see the demos
2:02:23
understand the concept then you can see and do it means just see it and
2:02:28
understand the concepts but otherwise if you want to practice it you have to invest this much amount per hour. Okay.
2:02:36
So if you practice for 10 hour then you have to invest $1 around 80 90 rupees in Indian currency that much you invest. So
2:02:42
I suggest uh whenever you have a plan to practice just quickly launch or practice
2:02:48
for some 3 4 hours that may be enough invest some 20 30 40 rupees and Indian currency and then that's all then
2:02:56
disconnect it or delete this okay if you want to do a practice other right now
2:03:01
you can just you can just see me as a demo otherwise you can invest this much amount okay this about
2:03:09
this this plan but we also need a worker node also guys.
2:03:16
Now this will you will decide okay EKS has no say on it. You will
2:03:23
decide you need one worker node, two worker node, three worker node. In this work node you need 4 GB RAM, 8 GB RAM, 2
2:03:32
GB RAM, 2 CPU, 4 CPU, 1 CPU, 10 hard disk.
2:03:39
All right, how much network speed you want? Okay. So that you will decide who we as
2:03:46
a user of the AWS EKS user will decide. Interesting thing is AWS will help you
2:03:52
to launch, help you do the setup, help you to connect because technically what happened this master node is IP IP less
2:04:00
IP1 individual computer right. So after we launch IP1 we have to connect this
2:04:06
IP1 to master node. Let's go register. After the register then only master node
2:04:12
can able to manage this. Okay. Then only this computer part of the cluster. Sim to register this guy.
2:04:18
We have to restore this guy. So first we have to launch this OS install the container engine then register the
2:04:25
master node. So this also kind of management. So in this price
2:04:32
they will do this management for you. Okay. Okay, there's no extra price for this. But
2:04:39
but okay, if you say no in this uh in this
2:04:44
uh worker node you need 4 GB RAM or two CPU that price you have to give
2:04:51
because that is equals to instance type right because finally they launch your
2:04:58
instance in service only. So whatever the issue to do instance type will charge that much price you will to give
2:05:04
these instances right up to you you don't have to launch it you don't have to install it and manage it they will
2:05:11
manage EC2 uh EC sorry EKS will manage for you but because you have this
2:05:18
flexibility here decide your node or uh worker node
2:05:27
size and type or this instance type whichever you choose and how much you launch that much
2:05:33
price based upon the price you to give understand one thing guys don't be conf
2:05:39
we are launching issue instances for the worker node but behind the scene it is
2:05:45
only for only for this purpose right this purpose
2:05:50
because I want base hardware per Linux per container engine so these three things we need and that they will
2:05:56
provide from EC2 instances But my application going to run on the top of container or top of that managed
2:06:03
by manager node. Okay. But my point is worker node price very depend upon how
2:06:10
much worker node you launch and which instance type you launch.
2:06:16
Okay. But the management they will do in the worker node also if you want to upgrade something they will manage for
2:06:22
you. And that is the reason this part
2:06:28
in the cluster is not known as fully managed. It's not fully managed. It is only the
2:06:34
managed. Managed means something they will do. Reming part you have to decide by your
2:06:40
planning. According plan you think these many port you have to launch then that much worker
2:06:47
node you have to do that capacity you have to plan and according to tell these guys EK services commands they will do
2:06:52
for you okay and that is the reason why EK service does not known as actually
2:07:00
compress service does not known as serverless service
2:07:05
because some part you have to manage manage mean you have to plan think according to your cap requirement
2:07:12
Okay. But if you want to make e service completely fully managed or fully
2:07:17
serverless then we will add far in the future to
2:07:22
make it completely fully managed. Why get we will talk in the upcoming advanced discussion of EKS.
2:07:30
Okay. But right now we just talk about the cubernetes only. And that is reason
2:07:35
we have a different pricing for the worker node. So if you just click here you will get the pricing for the worker
2:07:40
node and this pricing is equals to the pricing that you see in EC2.
2:07:46
Okay in EC2 so again so whatever see you guys in see
2:07:53
EC2 pricing come up right. So whatever you do in the pricing you can do it and you guys know by chance if you have free
2:08:00
tier T2 micro is free or T3 micros are free in some region now.
2:08:05
Okay. So if you have free tier so you don't have to invest for worker node we will launch our worker node in T2 micro
2:08:13
T3 micro. So here our price will save right for practice purpose and testing
2:08:19
purpose because in the worker node that much time they give you free but always in the real world whatever you select
2:08:26
okay that much ch uh price you have to pay. We'll talk more about it. I'm just giving you very quick information about
2:08:33
uh pricing before you start. So finally what I'm trying to say you here is uh a
2:08:40
worker node as such you don't have to pay if you use T2 micro control plane
2:08:46
you have to pay for control plane plus entire uh management of your cluster
2:08:54
okay management of worker and the master node that's 10.1
2:09:02
uh dollar or 10 cent I can say Okay. So there's a
2:09:10
there's a there. So guys law information I given to you
2:09:18
this much information might not be required but depend guys everyone has a different
2:09:24
point to be know wanted to know. So whichever information you think it's required for you just take those
2:09:30
information and go to the next step. Next step is there the main step that is
2:09:38
how we will launch the EKS cluster right that is the main part right
2:09:45
so I need five more minutes then we go for Q&A then we go break then I saw the
2:09:50
demo part but the the so there's multiple way to launch the EKS cluster
2:10:01
okay I can say launch a Kubernetes cluster with EKS service. There's a better term I can say one the simplest
2:10:09
way that's called web UI just come to this page
2:10:14
click create and do some something here and launch it. This is one of the way
2:10:20
simple way okay to uh to do so.
2:10:27
Second way is there's a famous tool in the market a third party tool
2:10:34
that tool is used in for other cloud also very famous product very mature
2:10:40
also a lot of guys in the cloud world they love this product this called terapform
2:10:47
this also can be used so most of cases in the corporate world I seen they use terapform to launch EKS
2:10:54
okay terapform give you multicloud hybrid cloud capabilities and many more
2:11:00
things right obviously this training is not about Terraform okay so we have a different training in terapform if you
2:11:05
want to go as you want to join you can join this training but we are not going to discuss here and neither I'm going to
2:11:11
show with web UI pretty simple you can use it to launch it I want to go for better method
2:11:18
that is suggested by AWS only so if you want to launch EKS then there's one
2:11:24
third party tool that is very very mature tool especially meant dedicated for EKS is called EKSCTL
2:11:32
is a tool or tool means it is also kind of command
2:11:38
okay this is come from third party company this company called V work who
2:11:43
created this tool kind of opensourced kind of tool okay they have a different
2:11:48
website altogether okay all together by V's work but the
2:11:54
tool so mature so powerful So easy almost whatever we want to do in the EK
2:11:59
world we can do it by this tool. So recently guys Amazon also make this tool
2:12:05
official. P was third party
2:12:11
we work but now Amazon also says now we are recommending in our official document to use this tool to manage the
2:12:18
EKS. Okay that's what we are going here. So we are going to use this tool for
2:12:25
managing this cluster by EKS or EKS services.
2:12:30
Okay. So I'll go for this tool is very interesting. Lots of very fantastic thing we can achieve by this tool. But
2:12:37
after the cluster launch after the cluster launch uh then then we will um see many more
2:12:47
thing happen behind the scene that it can done by EKS service or by EKCTL tool. Okay. So this was the plan guys to
2:12:55
start with the demo. So I'll go for right now Q&A then the break then after break we'll quickly jump to EKCTL tool
2:13:02
to launch EKS services or the Kubernetes cluster and then we have our own cluster
2:13:08
how we want to use you can use it and I I can also give the guarantee then after
2:13:13
having the cluster ready then all the things and vocabulary I explained to you makes more sense
2:13:20
okay and it might look little bit little bit maybe overwhelming if you guys are
2:13:25
new in Kubernetes is but when you see everything happening practical then you become more comfortable
2:13:32
about these vocabularies right so any query guys if you have you guys can ask me
2:13:40
so what difference between docker engine and there's nothing manos docker engine
2:13:46
actually okay docker is just a container management tool management tool for
2:13:51
something that managing one node But behind the scene docker use a engine
2:13:59
and that engine can be cry or container. So if you heard this term docker engine
2:14:05
maybe sometime I also use this term docker engine I also use okay but internally it means uh I'm
2:14:12
talking about container d. So container d is one internal program running behind
2:14:17
the scene. Okay. So if you guys know about docker demon you start docker demon if you see
2:14:24
the status of the docker demon you will see behind the scene that there's no docker demon running behind the scene
2:14:30
they are running containerd program okay so my point is manos what you're talking about
2:14:38
what I'm talking about we when I say docker engine technically
2:14:44
it is internally equals to container d similarly when I say docker demon It's
2:14:50
also technically equal to known as container D services.
2:14:55
Who manage HA? Uh web here. HA is managed by EKS by AWS. You don't have to
2:15:01
manage HA by your own. I'm talking about Kubernetes master. Master HA is managed
2:15:07
by EKS. Okay. So anybody here talking about run
2:15:12
C and C run. So guys run and CN is the not the engine, they are runtime.
2:15:19
So finally your container is run by something that is called runtime. Runtime is C run
2:15:27
this very new one or C run C. This was the older one we used right. So it is
2:15:34
something like this. So if you want I will explain this entire hierarchy of
2:15:40
container engine or runtime but it is not so much required right now because it is just this is mostly we cover in
2:15:47
the container training or the docker training or podman training or cryo
2:15:52
training maybe. Okay but yeah Kan what you asking is very relevant question run
2:15:57
C and C run two different tool it is only the run time.
2:16:04
Okay, runtime but it's not so much required right now for cubernetes training to know
2:16:15
master manager or which they use web they say they are managing they not reveal it mostly they use Linux only
2:16:22
Linux OS only but they are not showing us even though when I use some commander
2:16:29
also they won't show you there they say we are using it somewhere in their own personal area that's called
2:16:35
their own personal VPC that's called AWS VPC but yeah most probably they're using
2:16:40
Linux OS or custom Linux OS
2:16:51
so basically EK is used to manage control plane only right okay like if we
2:16:56
use Kubernetes only then it to manage control node yes this is main reason is
2:17:01
pandan if you are uh setting up your own cubernetes it's
2:17:08
called normally known as vanilla kubernetes everything you have to manage it's not
2:17:14
about management you have to invest also the money hardware and bandwidth hardware and uh many more things right
2:17:21
but if you saw EKS entire management of hardware networking security installing
2:17:26
setup maintenance HA better practices is because they're
2:17:33
launching master not in one AG they're launching multiple AG also if one AG goes down because disaster issues the
2:17:41
thing will is still working right so many more thing happen behind the scene right so but yeah financially yes
2:17:51
their responsibility is to manage control plan that's what that's what talking about that's that is one of the
2:17:56
main critical thing corporate world is talking about Okay. What entry point is same? Uh
2:18:03
Siddiki, I'm not taking this answer right now. This purely the question of Docker file. Uh so my Docker training is
2:18:10
available free in IA connect channel in YouTube where I cover Docker from very
2:18:16
basic to advanc. We have one dedicated entire session on Docker file. There I
2:18:21
explain you the entry point and cmd keyword. But in this training there's no good meaning to discuss about this
2:18:26
points. Yes, say pashad in CI/CD pipeline. Okay,
2:18:35
integration of EKS made lot of sense. I will give you some concept and idea on it in upcoming discussion.
2:18:42
Okay, so we can build in our CI/CD pipeline. We can integrate the EKS to
2:18:50
for running our app and for deploying the app especially the CD part. Okay,
2:18:56
what I mean by this as we progress say I will talk about it.
2:19:02
Splunk can be used to plunk is a great tool we should know but Splunk has their own use case. There's a monitoring tool
2:19:08
or log management tool. You can integrate Splunk with EKS and other
2:19:14
tools to collect the log to see the graph and dashboard and monitoring purpose. But
2:19:20
there's no right now there's no meaning right now to to talk about Splunk with
2:19:25
EKS. But yeah, if I don't know what context you're asking here, Splunk can be also integrated with EKS. If you're
2:19:32
asking this point
2:19:39
uh group Prasad, I show you here HSBC bank using EKS and they're getting lot of benefits. Okay, I highly suggest if
2:19:46
you're talking and and want to know about the use case what banks
2:19:52
can be done on the top of EKS. So if you go to EK space in the customer
2:20:00
there's one good complete case study of HSBC bank over here how they're getting
2:20:06
the benefit okay you can get from here from this customer page
2:20:13
okay so but uh this is one point yeah if you say if some transaction fail that is
2:20:20
not done by any of the deployment tool that has been managed by your applications your code
2:20:27
or your databases. So how you write the code, how you managing the the entire transaction in your database, in your
2:20:34
code, you know the concept called atomicity and entire transaction, right?
2:20:39
That can be done by your coding, your cloud tool or your container tool
2:20:46
or your cubernetes kind of tool. They give you a environment to launch your app.
2:20:54
Okay. and give you the involvement something fail then we'll do something we monitor many more thing but but if
2:21:01
you have a thing that if transaction fail is information information normally
2:21:06
managed by the code so is the developer perspective how they write the code and
2:21:11
how they see the transaction and the automosity of your concepts and the transaction that would be a pure uh game
2:21:19
of the developer how they write the code inside it inside your
2:21:25
Okay, I will definitely Deepak will I will def discuss something about difference between EKS and open safe.
2:21:32
Let me first show you the entire EKS first because right now I haven't discussed much about EKS. I just show
2:21:37
you the base story line. Okay, after I show you the EKS some of the interesting demos, then I can very easily
2:21:47
able to explain you the difference between EKS and the open s right.
2:21:54
Okay. Yes. Uh Subum you can migrate your workload with EKS and GKE and AKS. So uh
2:22:01
so guys Azure also have the EKS service called AKS. Google also have EKS service kind of service called G GKE. So if you
2:22:08
want to migrate your workload or distribute workload with different different um
2:22:15
um uh service provider by having one single product also that's also we can
2:22:21
somehow we can do it. I might give some higher ideas in upcoming discussion. It's not part of
2:22:26
program but I will give that idea how we can do this.
2:22:40
So as you told AWS also provides similar name service ECS
2:22:46
how EKS is better than ECS. Uh I'm not I haven't say Hansmanu ECS is better than
2:22:53
EKS is a two different independent service in AWS.
2:22:59
Okay. Point is if you want to use Kubernetes
2:23:06
there not is open source tool then you can go for EKS. If your company
2:23:12
need Kubernetes to be used but they don't want to manage Kubernetes that mostly
2:23:18
company does not want to manage then you can use EKS.
2:23:23
Okay. But AWS also one more service called ECS. If you want to manage your containers
2:23:30
without the Kubernetes okay then you can use ECS there's no EKS
2:23:37
is there there's no sorry no Kubernetes there but you can launch the containers and do the things minimum facility they
2:23:43
give you okay uh this point so these are two different tool now you have to choose do
2:23:49
you want to launch application in the Kubernetes environment because I want to get the
2:23:55
power of Kubernetes Kubernetes have a lot of things to perform Some of the example I give you but there many more thing to be done can be done
2:24:02
by Kubernetes. So if you want to utilize the power of Kubernetes
2:24:08
I'm just only going to cover Kubernetes then you can go for EKS
2:24:13
but ECS does not give you Kubernetes power. It's just a
2:24:20
service given by AWS just to manage the container. I think they're using docker
2:24:25
and something behind the scene, right? But if you want to know more about the
2:24:30
defense, maybe I talk more about it. EKS and ECS service defense. But game is
2:24:36
simple. He wants to just think in this way. Do you need Kubernetes or your company need Kubernetes? If yes, means
2:24:44
they want to utilize the power of Kubernetes. If yes, then we can go for EKS.
2:24:53
Okay, that's how we can think of. Okay.
2:25:01
So when terapform class start uh vindu there's no assess plan right now. Recently I deliver one training of
2:25:07
terapform. So there's no plan for at least for some months. But yeah we I think we are providing recorded classes.
2:25:14
So that what you can team talk to our team they will help you.
2:25:24
So is the process of launching cubain on premise cloud is same? Yeah, say if you are launching cub by yourself
2:25:33
that made me by you. So the command that you use on premise same cloud you can same command you can use on cloud. You
2:25:39
can launch your own instances EC2 and launch it by yourself. Okay.
2:25:46
But if you want this to be launched by AWS then you can use EKS. They have their
2:25:51
own commands. That's what I'm going to show you in some some time.
2:25:57
Yes. uh I want to clear one more point here is uh maybe I might have right here. So my intention here is to tell
2:26:04
you you can launch EKS with anything what AWS do is when I say web UI it means C
2:26:11
cli also it means API also. So these are the three things AWS provide you. So you
2:26:18
can launch EKS with web UI CLI and API. This is the AWS own way.
2:26:25
This is one way to launch EKS anyone. Second one is terraform is a third party
2:26:30
tool and third is EKS again third party tool but is recommend by AWS that's what we're going to use. Okay.
2:26:45
So um can we mate the unmanaged cubernetes we is to do I have some point to be
2:26:52
discussed Romesh in this part. So as we progress I I'll talk about it
2:27:00
about the migration perspective. Okay. Even though there's one very fantastic facility in EKS we have all
2:27:07
right we are running the controller node in AWS but they have a capability
2:27:14
to manage your worker node in your own premises.
2:27:19
This this kind of hybrid setup also we can do in EKS. how I will talk about it
2:27:24
in my upcoming discussion.
2:27:32
So uh Mohawk if you
2:27:39
the part of my AWS training going on okay the CSA or
2:27:46
developer track or I can say uh cloud enablement training. So yesterday only we covered this topic okay in EBS volume
2:27:54
we covered this topic this encryption at rest. So in my last last class we have covered this topic. Obviously it's not
2:28:01
part of EKS but in my AWS training we have covered this topic already. Okay.
2:28:09
Yes Ankit we can launch multiple container slave node. That's what master we manage. I show you in the demo part of it.
2:28:31
So cloud formation sub is used for different purpose right if you want to automate your services
2:28:37
in AWS there we use cloud formation okay so in my if you are part of my as
2:28:44
training like CSA training other training where we have a cloud formation topic going to cover we'll discuss there
2:28:49
but we can't link this formation with EKS EKS a service helping you to launch cube
2:28:56
Kubernetes cluster. No, when get is name space and cluster
2:29:03
node same thing. Cluster is what I explained to you multiple computer master slave worker node together
2:29:12
known as cluster what name space after a cluster launch then I'll show you inside
2:29:19
the cluster we have a name spaces what are those I'll show you
2:29:24
no ek ekctl command measla it is free is opensource tool kind of so if you want
2:29:31
to use ekl tool is free to use but obviously EKC2 tool is going to launch a
2:29:37
EKS cluster. EKS cluster will charge you as account.
2:29:50
So how to calculate the number of port per node it all depend uh actually upon
2:29:56
application to application right it's not fixed rule or fixed formula for this
2:30:02
I give some idea on it okay this called you know the capacity
2:30:08
planning okay normally we do learn the capacity planning uh especially in the cubernetes training
2:30:16
I told you there's no cubernetes training because there we have a board discussion in detail and many more thing
2:30:22
uh but I give some idea about this capacity planning. So how can you come to know uh how much port how many port
2:30:31
we need per node. Okay, but it all depend upon because in the port we have
2:30:36
a we have a application right how much application need as a resources vary
2:30:42
from application to application no name space and context are two
2:30:47
different thing again we when we go after we launch the cluster I will show you name space different thing context
2:30:54
is the different thing no an um uh in one slave node is like
2:31:04
one OS and in one OS we can launch multiple container or multiple port okay so it's
2:31:12
not like this one slave is one one is not like this okay otherwise why we need a container there I have one OS I want
2:31:19
to launch multiple OS so so one one node one computer I want to launch multiple OS or multiple containers
2:31:26
so so master will going to handle all the container in one particular node
2:31:38
So, so let's do guys um anything otherwise whatever you asking it would be will be more clear when we start the
2:31:46
demonstration part of it you will get more more idea on on it okay so let's go
2:31:53
for quick break of around 20 minute or 22 minutes I can say so at uh 4
2:32:03
we will continue and this will be very important topic because I'm going to show you the entire cluster setup or
2:32:09
entire ease setup right so we'll resume this break according to my system time
2:32:15
1640 IST time okay I see you
2:55:42
Hey guys, uh welcome back and let's continue with the next part.
2:55:48
So plan uh guys would be uh we are going to launch the
2:55:54
Kubernetes cluster. Okay. So there's a plan. So Kubernetes we can
2:56:01
write with the short-term E KS. But this cluster we going to launch or set up and
2:56:07
managed fully by service called EKS. And guys it is not only
2:56:15
uh creating the cluster. Okay. There lot many thing EKS will give to you. I will
2:56:22
explain you after we launch it. Right. So right now I'm using uh EKS cluster to
2:56:29
create Kubernetes sorry EKS service of AWS
2:56:36
to create or launch Kubernetes cluster. Okay. But how to integrate or how to
2:56:45
sorry how to use this service.
2:56:50
Okay. So for this we will I will use my personal here this laptop what I'm
2:56:57
sitting right now and here we will install one tool and name of the tool is
2:57:03
called EKS ctl2 okay so right now my system is Windows
2:57:10
maybe Linux or Mac does not matter in this system
2:57:15
we will install this tool okay and with this tool we run something write some
2:57:21
command because this tool is like a command actually uh and this command will contact to EKS services to the AWS
2:57:28
cloud and finally they launch the cluster. This is how uh the processor would be. Okay. But one more thing we
2:57:36
need. Okay. Whichever tool you use, you can use EKS tool or AWS CI tool or
2:57:42
whatever you use sorry whatever you use. Okay. Minimum
2:57:50
requirement is if you're running this tool or the command from your uh basic system. So your system have to
2:57:56
authenticate to AWS cloud. So, right now,
2:58:04
let's hold for a second, please.
2:58:29
So, so first requirement is in my windows. I will open my Windows command
2:58:35
line terminal. Okay. I will first authenticate my
2:58:40
system or my terminal with the AWS cloud. And for this you know we will
2:58:46
create some AM user in AWS.
2:58:51
Okay. So for my Windows I can authenticate here. Okay. So the first
2:58:59
step would be I'm going to create a IM user and where I'm going to create a key
2:59:04
this access key secret key this first step then I will open my Windows
2:59:10
terminal here because from here I want to set up everything from this terminal I will use one command called AWS
2:59:17
command and using this command I will use this key to authenticate
2:59:24
okay that's what I'm doing here right Now and again one more thing guys if you
2:59:30
want to use AWS command you need to install AWS CLI also.
2:59:36
Okay. So those who know a little bit about AWS, this is very common thing you guys might know. But the process would
2:59:41
be very very uh simple. The step one
2:59:46
would be I have to install AWS CLI. Then we will create IM user
2:59:55
so I can have a key. Then I will use AWS
3:00:01
CLI to authenticate to AWS cloud.
3:00:08
Okay, there's the minimum thing we have to do first. Okay, then we will go for main part.
3:00:15
Then after your Windows has been authenticated. Now we can use any tool EKCTL or any other tool. The minimum
3:00:21
tool we can use in the future also uh to use right. But here then after this we
3:00:26
can use EKSCl tool to
3:00:32
connect with EKS service to launch cluster. Okay.
3:00:39
So this will be process right. So let's start uh let's do step by step. So first
3:00:44
of all what I have to do if you search for AWS CLI for Windows or Linux.
3:00:51
Okay. You can search this link you will get. Okay. And this link you can download
3:01:00
tool for Linux, Windows and Mac. Okay. Click and download. Install it. So in my
3:01:06
case I already have this tool. Okay. So I don't want to install otherwise I'm just showing you this link to you. It's
3:01:13
just a tool or the software. Install it. Okay. This one. So in my case after you
3:01:19
install uh then open your command prompt and if you run for AWS version to
3:01:25
confirm you can see this tool been installed. So you can confirm with this
3:01:30
command that AWS command line tool has been installed or not.
3:01:35
Okay. Now I move to a IM user. So for this
3:01:42
what I'm going to do I'll go and um uh where my console is
3:01:52
I'll go and use my account okay
3:01:59
and there's a service guys called IM through which you can create account in AWS
3:02:05
and again these are the one one time setup we have to do so just go to this
3:02:16
And in the user section here just go and create a account. Let's say this is
3:02:22
Linux world user some name whatever name you can give does not matter. Okay. Click next. And every account you have
3:02:29
to give some power. Okay. So this policy you have to attach
3:02:34
because from this user you have to authenticate
3:02:40
to manage EKS service. So you can create account to give only EKS service power but many more power
3:02:47
you have to give. So right now I'm not discussing this point. We will discuss little more crispy about what power and
3:02:54
permission we should give give to to make it simple. Okay. What I'm going to do, I'm
3:03:00
attaching the admin power that give the entire power. Okay, it's not good practice. But right
3:03:07
now, initial demo will be rendered very quickly because I want to focus more on EKS part. Click next and create user.
3:03:17
Okay. And this user is new created. When I click on this user in the security
3:03:23
credentials, there's option called create key. I'll go and create a key for command line
3:03:29
where I want to login to AWS cloud from my command line and they give me key.
3:03:38
So this part is done. This key has been created and this key is called access
3:03:43
secret key we have with us. Next step is we have to login the command line
3:03:50
and for login we have to use a command called AWS configure and that is reason guys why I installed the software
3:03:58
I want to sorry I want to login in my command line
3:04:03
okay here they ask me the access key I'll copy my access key from here past
3:04:10
then I'll copy my secret key here so for this I'm stop sharing my screen I I
3:04:15
don't want to show my admin power access key here. I post here. Okay, one minute.
3:04:22
I'll again start sharing my screen in a minute.
3:04:29
And now that's all. So these are very basic thing. Those who know basic AWS
3:04:35
they know this but I show you very quickly. Okay. And you want which region you want to work on. Most of the things
3:04:41
I want to work in Mumbai region. So this is ID of the Mumbai. You can type
3:04:46
and that's all. So finally with the help of this command
3:04:54
with the help of this command you have authenticated your local system. Okay this is your local laptop it does
3:05:01
no matter Linux Windows uh laptop to the as command uh as cloud. So
3:05:11
there's a minimum requirement you have to do whichever kind of tool you use this part is done. Okay. The main part
3:05:17
is I told you already we are going to launch the uh use the EK service to
3:05:24
launch the cluster but this service we have to
3:05:30
manage by this tool. Okay. And from where you can get this
3:05:37
tool. Okay. You can get this tool either you can search for AWS EKS
3:05:43
documentation somewhere you can get the link
3:05:49
from where you can download this tool okay in the user guide and all the
3:05:55
things or you can directly search EKS
3:06:01
EKSCTL you will get this website here and this website
3:06:08
Right? You will get uh one link in the top there called GitHub link.
3:06:16
Okay. And in the GitHub link, you will find in the right side
3:06:23
there's releases over here. Okay. If you click all the version of
3:06:29
EKCL command line will going to come up. There's a pre-release. This might not be stable. But if you go down there's a
3:06:36
stable release latest one we're going to use this version of AKCTL
3:06:42
and if you don't want to download the software to go down you can download of
3:06:48
Windows or Linux and Mac option going to come up in my case I want to use in my Windows Windows is my AMD 64bit
3:06:59
okay so I click and this tool will download. Okay, after download we
3:07:05
install it. So this is the URL from where you can get this tool or this
3:07:12
command line. Okay. And guys, right now we are using inst uh
3:07:18
installing this tool but there's many more command and tool we have installed.
3:07:24
Okay. So what I'm going to do, I'm going to keep all the command. For example, in the future
3:07:30
I might have to use helm command or cubectl command and many more command I have to install my windows.
3:07:37
Okay. So what I'm going to do to organize this command properly in my windows I'll go
3:07:45
to my C drive C drive and see I'm in the program file.
3:07:53
Okay. I'll create one folder. You can create anywhere but here mostly
3:08:00
we keep the things mostly in the program file folder. I'm going to create one folder where there it is. Here it is.
3:08:07
Let me give the name of this folder. Let's say this a EKS
3:08:13
tools some folder or AWS EKS tool. Whatever name you can give give you can give here.
3:08:20
Okay. And this is empty folder. Nothing special here. I'm going to organize all
3:08:25
of my tool here. Copy here because tool is more like a command.
3:08:31
Okay. So that's all. And after you download this software.
3:08:38
Okay. So there may be some kind of warning they giving you. We can discard this. But after download this tool, you can
3:08:45
extract this tool and install it. So this tool has been downloaded. Double click
3:08:52
this tool is extracted is like a normal executor file. extract this and I will
3:08:59
have to keep in my C drive in my program file and the folder that I created right
3:09:06
now I want to keep there folder name was
3:09:12
AWS some name right uh where it is
3:09:18
is a program file this one I want to copy inside this folder or extract inside this folder
3:09:27
Okay. So that's all guys. Uh yeah this tool what I was talking about has been
3:09:32
installed after download double click install and I copy in this fold. So
3:09:37
there's a tool or the command line. Similarly many more tool we need in the future we need I will keep on telling
3:09:43
you. So everything I'm going to keep here and because we know where we're keeping the command. So what can we do
3:09:50
in your operating system? we can set the environmental variable so that we don't have to come every time
3:09:56
through this folder. We can run this count from anywhere. So what I'm going to do again one time setup I'll go to my
3:10:03
env. If I type in windows click on environmental variable and click on the
3:10:08
environment again. Okay. And there's a option here go path.
3:10:14
Okay. It means we are setting up that we have some more new path going to come up in my windows where we keep one some
3:10:21
more new commands. So I'm going to add this path and here I'm going to add this
3:10:27
new path. Okay. New path. That's all. Okay. And okay.
3:10:37
And okay. It means now you don't have to come to this folder again again to run this.
3:10:43
This command you can run from anywhere. How can I say this? For this whatever
3:10:48
terminal you open guys first close it because whenever set any path you do close terminal again start then it will
3:10:54
work. Again open the terminal. Now wherever you are does not matter. We have ekctl
3:11:01
command available. How I know if I hit enter there's no error and they show you even
3:11:07
though uh that's all multiple options whatever the support come up even though we can run the version
3:11:14
to confirm this. So this version of ek will be installed. Okay. So guys our setup is ready.
3:11:22
Nothing very complex. This is basic thing we always do in AWS. This is extra thing we have done and finally we
3:11:31
installed this tool. Now that's all guys only thing is we
3:11:39
have this tool we can use the service to launch the cluster. It means without
3:11:44
going to AWS cloud where it is
3:11:50
in this service. Okay, without coming here it will launch
3:11:56
our cluster. So if you notice here in the cluster left side I have no cluster here zero cluster I can launch it right.
3:12:04
How very very simple command they have. Okay in ekctl if you hit enter they give
3:12:12
a help and if you want to create something then they have a create command.
3:12:19
Again if you hit enter they say what you want to create. So
3:12:25
what is node group? There many more thing we going to see in the future classes. Okay forget also we have here
3:12:31
but I'm going to create a cluster and get a cluster. That's all guys. This is the only thing you have to write. Just
3:12:38
by hitting this entire powerful industry use case kind of cluster will be ready
3:12:45
for you in some minute. Okay. And some I I suggest guys if
3:12:51
you're following along with me this demo don't do this. Don't run this command. Why? I'll tell you in a minute. I'll
3:12:58
give you better command in a minute. But I'm running this command right now. You don't try. Okay. But what you'll see now
3:13:05
there's a lot of process happening. It take around 15 to 20 minutes
3:13:10
to launch the entire cluster. Okay. and what they doing behind the
3:13:17
scene. Okay, I will explain you here. But what you will see
3:13:23
in the Mumbai, if you see here in the Mumbai, you can say somewhere in the region Mumbai.
3:13:31
Okay, here in ES now you refresh in some second you will see one cluster going to
3:13:37
come up here. Okay. And every cluster they give a name by chance here they give the cluster
3:13:42
name amazing penting some random name they give you. So you can some you will see here sometime you will see a cluster
3:13:48
with this name called what a name they give you. We can change also but this is by default they give you they launch in
3:13:55
the Mumbai. Okay Mumbai here and what they doing?
3:14:02
Okay, technically what they launch or what they launching actually because I
3:14:08
just use a cluster create command. I does not mention anything. So they launch one controller node that is
3:14:15
called manager node. Okay, that we can't control. They have
3:14:20
the best case scenario whatever they have uh best practices I can say they
3:14:25
launch for you. that does not tell you what they're doing, how much uh RAM and
3:14:31
CPU they put, but they put all the best or whatever the we always need. But
3:14:38
because it is fully managed but the target sorry the the slave node or the
3:14:44
worker node we have a control we can decide
3:14:49
that which worker node we want to launch which means which instance type how much RAM and CPU right now because I did not
3:14:56
tell this guy which worker node I want to launch. So they use a worker node
3:15:01
final technically they launch two worker node by the way here. Okay. So by default they launch two work
3:15:07
on node. I'll show you somewhere. They might write somewhere or they're going to show you in a minute. So they're
3:15:13
going to launch two work. It will come in a minute. They're launching still.
3:15:19
Um so
3:15:26
format.
3:15:32
So so delete in progress. Uh guys there's some issue come up here
3:15:40
in this command because of some setting preset in my current Mumbai account I think. So they are conflicting.
3:15:46
I can clear it. Maybe I does not clear it properly. Okay. So what I'm going to
3:15:53
do I'm going to launch one more time here. But this time I'm going to launch
3:15:59
in other region. Let's say very quickly let me select Singapore. Okay. So something they're conflicting I
3:16:06
had already I can clean it. So I don't want to invest that time. So what I'm going to do I'm using again my as
3:16:13
configure command because here we can give our access key secret key and I can set my default
3:16:20
region also. So I want whatever I do I will do in this region AP southeast one.
3:16:27
Okay. Now let me run this cluster again by the same command. Now they will
3:16:33
launch EKCR they choose this region from your configure command and EKC will use
3:16:39
a login and password again they take from configure command to connect the cluster
3:16:45
okay and here they are going to create a cluster in the Singapore region in my case and they are g they have provided
3:16:52
here the name called Amazing Creature some name the cluster name going to come up in a minute okay
3:17:00
so this one thing now What I'm trying to tell you here is this command what I use
3:17:05
right now mostly we don't want to use this command is a quick way to s create
3:17:10
a cluster but ek command give you lots of powerful way to customize your entire
3:17:16
cluster the way you want to customize and many more deep discussion we're going to do in upcoming discussion right
3:17:22
but right now EKS create cluster by default is going to launch two
3:17:28
node only with some some instance type I'll tell you the name. Okay. But that
3:17:34
instant what are they using right now is not free. It come with cost. Right. So
3:17:39
that is a one of the reason I ask you again they have some some challenge.
3:17:47
One minute.
3:17:54
Uh one minute guys.
3:18:01
Mhm. Upgrade fetching stack tableting course.
3:18:11
One minute guys loud.
3:18:19
One.
3:18:26
So
3:18:34
one more guys there some resource I already have they're conflicting with this I'm using the by default if I
3:18:40
customize then it might not work I don't want to customize right now to explain some more concept for this or
3:18:48
what I'm going to do right now if it's not again working is take some time maybe to delete
3:18:55
so what I'm doing right now to quickly uh show you this demo because this is
3:19:00
one guy let me very quickly see have a look net gateway fail fail because guys EKS you create
3:19:09
lots of thing behind the scene and that's what the plan for my discussion upcoming discussion right but I have to
3:19:15
clean everything it take a lot of time okay so
3:19:21
so uh what I'm going to do I'm going to use a different account here. Okay. So, I
3:19:28
think this account might not have a cluster preset. I think this is clean, but my a lot of things might not be
3:19:35
clean. Let me check very quickly.
3:19:43
Hold on guys, one minute.
3:19:48
Yeah. So, there a lot of thing guys is there not yet deleted. It might take some time. So, what I'm going to do, I'm
3:19:54
going to log to my different account. Let me stop sharing and let me do the same thing again there.
3:20:09
The same thing I'm going to do, but let me log to uh different account.
3:20:19
One like this.
3:20:36
So guys, stop sharing my screen actually. So because this is new account, I need
3:20:43
IM account to be created. Same thing I'm doing very very quickly.
3:20:53
So by the meantime cluster will up because it takes some
3:20:59
minute to launch. I will explain you the next concepts
3:21:05
and with power next
3:21:10
create my user this time I have explained to you already so I'm doing very very quickly
3:21:17
access key command line just click create
3:21:24
and I use my again my AWS configure command to tell that my new
3:21:33
access key is this one. I'm so sorry to stop sharing a screen again one more time
3:21:40
and my secret key is this one
3:21:48
and AP south one again I'm setting to Mumbai that's all
3:21:54
so I just give the new account detail
3:22:00
and nothing this is changing the new account detail
3:22:05
It will be now launch in a different account. So again same command ekctl create cluster is a full tested command.
3:22:13
Yes something they do by default this this command will create. So if you delete your cluster you to remove this
3:22:19
part also. So in my last account didn't so they are conflicting but in the fence account there's no issue it should will
3:22:27
it will create right. So here in the EKS
3:22:37
uh cluster in the Mumbai region if you go to cluster here in some minute you will see
3:22:46
they will create the cluster okay take around 20 minutes total to have
3:22:52
this cluster running but what what they doing guys behind the scene okay what
3:22:58
they're doing master they won't show view but they will launch two instances
3:23:03
and these two instances guys will launch inside EC2 services.
3:23:09
So after this worker node launch you can go to EC2 page and you can see two
3:23:14
instances running there that's one thing okay so it means whatever the instance
3:23:21
type you attach that much price or cost you have to pay right now they attach to
3:23:26
some higher instance type that is costing much so that is I ask them ask
3:23:32
you come on right what is happening it should work Right.
3:23:39
Some other issue.
3:23:45
There's some other issue here. There is actually other issue happening.
3:23:55
It should work normally always. So there might be some other issue
3:24:04
about it.
3:24:15
Only one only one stick found ready cluster. There should be at least two
3:24:23
guys.
3:24:46
Uh it always work. What is challenge here?
3:24:55
Let me check some more logging.
3:25:06
I'll do one more thing in the in in
3:25:12
parallel sometime region also the challenge because in some of the reason if you try to launch these kind of
3:25:20
services they are not allowed disabled by default especially free this is a possibility so let me try to use
3:25:27
Virginia region okay is US is to one
3:25:33
I'm changing the register region. Okay, there's also maybe possibility
3:25:38
sometime. Okay, let's see.
3:25:47
Okay, so by the meantime, let me explain for the concept. We'll save what time, right? So, what can we do? We can
3:25:53
customize this ekctl command. ektl command to
3:26:00
uh to uh to tell that how many node you need
3:26:07
by default they launch two but we can say we want three or we can also say I
3:26:13
want t2 micro and small and t3 micro those setting also we can do so I'll
3:26:18
show you how we can do this customization then you can also do the demo along with me this is one thing but
3:26:25
before this you should know one interesting concept how EKS is managing your worker node. So
3:26:34
this concept is very important. Okay, let me go to my screen again. I'm very
3:26:39
much worried about this uh because this command is foolproof command.
3:26:46
Normally does not fail. Okay. And um
3:26:52
uh it is failing it maybe
3:27:00
because something is going on AWS cloud at this point in time maybe they're upgrading some services resource limit I
3:27:07
don't know something is there okay something is there
3:27:13
okay otherwise this command is the tested command work well this This is also what
3:27:20
recommended by this guy also. This is a commanded run. That's all.
3:27:26
And they that's what I'm talking about. They launched two worker node with M5
3:27:32
extra large. Okay. With some autogener name and they launch EKS.
3:27:39
Okay. So, so the point is
3:27:46
Okay. The point is um it should work but I think something is going on in the
3:27:52
cluster as world otherwise it shouldn't fail or let me delete my cluster they
3:27:59
automate delete actually well let me delete one more time this cluster let me try one more time
3:28:06
okay so cluster delete what are the things they have done they deleted let me try one more time so what I do I
3:28:13
don't know because this command we run always in work. So let me do some
3:28:18
customization there might be possibility the T3 T5
3:28:25
um where it is and M5 large worker node is there
3:28:31
obviously but might not be there let's say so we we'll try to customize it right but it would work always right so
3:28:39
let me try one more time by the meantime I will explain you
3:28:44
okay u Okay. And one more small thing I want
3:28:50
to test here. There's one more small thing I want to test here is
3:28:56
I downloaded this command
3:29:03
in my windows in this folder. There one more possibility
3:29:11
in this folder. And what I'm doing here actually
3:29:16
this also guys sometime happen I have because ek command I have multiple
3:29:23
version with me in my system and everything is has the path set
3:29:29
so I manually go to this path and see the version this is challenge actually
3:29:36
okay this is challenge so challenge is not with the command or the cloud challenge is in my laptop top why if I
3:29:44
open one more command terminal okay uh and if you run ekl command my
3:29:50
same system you can see there's a version difference this very very old version and this is latest version we
3:29:55
installed today okay so point is this they are failing
3:30:00
not because of they have a issue because the command that I'm using is very old
3:30:07
and that does not support the new feature of EKS Okay. So from the output it very harder
3:30:15
to find out the challenge but uh but this is challenge actually I believe.
3:30:21
Okay. This is challenge. I was using this older version. Okay. So why this
3:30:28
challenge in my laptop you won't face this challenge because in my laptop I installed this version multiple time and
3:30:34
every time I have the path set. So will if I go to my environmental variable again
3:30:41
setting if I go to path and edit you can see this is the path I said this also
3:30:48
one of the path I had or maybe I might have more software
3:30:54
installed maybe in terapform also somewhere also right so they're using some version from the other path right
3:31:02
so what I'm trying to tell you here is this is not issue of this uh command And this is the version issue, right? So, so
3:31:08
now onward what I'm going to do, I don't want to run this command in this way. Let me come out from here. Okay, let me
3:31:15
come out from here. I'll go to this folder. How? Let me show
3:31:22
you again those who does not know this even the very basic thing. So, wherever you install guys tool, go to this path,
3:31:29
use the cd command, reach there, list it. This is a software we installed today only
3:31:36
today and then you can use the software and confirm also the version is
3:31:42
latest one. Now let's create the cluster. So command create cluster and
3:31:48
pretty sure it should work even though I can go for other alter account also but let me use the same one.
3:31:55
Okay and at least let me change one small thing. Let me launch Mumbai.
3:32:03
AP southward. So command is ekkl
3:32:08
create cluster. I think this would be the only challenge.
3:32:14
Yeah. So it look like new version they use this tool
3:32:20
because anything change in the AWS cloud the client tool they keep on updating
3:32:26
accordingly. Okay. Uh that's what they're doing and
3:32:31
I'm pretty sure this might be the issue otherwise we can troubleshoot more but let's see it will work right so so now I
3:32:40
think it will work guys in the Mumbai region it will work
3:32:45
okay and uh by the meantime they're launching I want to explain more vocabulary about this but if I go to my
3:32:52
Kubernetes in the Mumbai region of this account
3:32:59
of this account. Uh yeah, now it is working right. So I was uh Python's
3:33:05
right. So there was the issue was with the version what I had multiple. Right?
3:33:11
Now you can see this status creating this is a name of my cluster just a name
3:33:17
you can give anything but by default they take this name of your cluster or your control plane.
3:33:24
Okay, this is one thing and launching in the Mumbai that's what you can see here.
3:33:31
Okay. Now what I'm trying to explain you further, right?
3:33:38
So there's very important concept you should know about
3:33:44
EKS. Okay. Uh MA master node guys they will manage
3:33:52
themselves. But point is when you launch that uh
3:33:58
launch a node that's called worker node. You will decide
3:34:05
how many worker node you need. Let's say you decide four worker node you need.
3:34:11
This concept is very important what I'm explaining to you. So let's say you need four worker node.
3:34:18
And now what can one more thing you can do you can say this worker node I need
3:34:24
to T2 micro this worker node I need T2 micro mean 1
3:34:29
GB RAM 1 CPU this worker node you can decide I need T3 micro
3:34:36
or T3 small or T2 small for example this work I need T2 small I'm talking about
3:34:41
instance type means this much RAM and CPU
3:34:46
okay so you have multiple different combinations right where you guys know one more thing
3:34:53
in AWS we have a different different way we can take the uh take the instances we
3:35:00
can go for on demand you can go for reserve one you can go for spot instances that is very cheap so we can
3:35:07
have multiple combination what I mean what I mean by this we'll discuss in upcoming discussion right but point here
3:35:13
is your worker node okay you can decide ide your combination whatever combination you can decide
3:35:21
okay so let's say you decide A and B you want two worker node with T2 micro
3:35:30
C and D you decide two worker node for small maybe
3:35:35
why small there's a possibility small let's say give you 2 GB RAM
3:35:40
and T2 micro let's say they give 1 GB RAM and you know in the future there's some application going to come up they
3:35:46
need more than 1 GB RAM Okay. So obviously we want able to launch here right. So that time my
3:35:53
master will decide they will find 2GB RAM here and they launch my container port here. So that can be one of the
3:36:00
reason right. So my point is we can have your worker
3:36:06
node worker node as per your convenience. Right. Second important that's very
3:36:13
critical thing is okay as a good practice you know this worker node is a
3:36:20
internally EC2 instances this is also instances
3:36:26
okay and you know one more thing every instance is launch in one ag
3:36:31
so you know this is a this is uh Mumbai and if you uh when guys this cluster
3:36:38
launch what can you see In the EC2
3:36:44
service they will launch two instances okay in the Mumbai only. So you can see
3:36:49
in some minute you will find there's two instances they launch here in the in the
3:36:55
Mumbai it's not it come up
3:37:01
why only seven I have from all all the classes but
3:37:08
there's no EKS related instances here why because my cluster is still building
3:37:15
after my cluster master node build and then they start launching the um the
3:37:20
worker node. So as soon working order start you'll see there's two more instances going to come up here automatically they install automatically
3:37:27
they configure automatically everything they do for you
3:37:33
but my my point here is uh you know whenever you launch any instance the
3:37:38
instance always launch in data center a 1 A or 1 B. So good practice says uh for
3:37:46
the disaster purpose if any disaster happen in in one a data center.
3:37:52
Okay. So if you want uh your service to be keep on running or keep on available.
3:38:01
Okay. So what can you do? Same computer you can launch in one day.
3:38:08
So that by chance if your port or container application running here due
3:38:14
to any service disruption any disaster happened climatic
3:38:19
conditions if the entire data center goes down so at least you have one
3:38:27
sorry at least you have one instance running in other AGS.
3:38:34
Okay. So technically for the master perspective they feel this is a worker
3:38:39
node. They will launch same container here. So your applications keep on running. But the AWS perspective
3:38:48
okay they are giving you ages so that
3:38:54
sorry guys so that uh if due to any issue of disaster
3:39:02
right you can plan this also so what I'm trying to tell you guys here is what I'm
3:39:08
discussing to you is not again done is is not done by you it again automatically done by EKS Yes, I'm just
3:39:16
giving you this information that because now we have a cloud cloud multiple data center as so we can utilize this power
3:39:23
and try to manage our disaster recovery plans that rather than keep one
3:39:31
uh instance in all the instance some same ages you can spread or distributed
3:39:37
our instances or work on node to different different aes
3:39:42
okay So fourth is what can you do? Okay, you don't have to do anything.
3:39:49
Only thing you have to tell to the EKS that we are going to launch one instance, we going to launch one more
3:39:56
instance. I want both the instance have T2 micro for example. I want whenever
3:40:03
you launch this instance or this instance from a worker node distribute this instant in different different ages
3:40:13
port this okay you have to group this computers or this instances in a group
3:40:20
and that group is called node group
3:40:27
can hold for a second
3:41:02
Okay. So node group. So node group is a one concept in EKS service that we can
3:41:08
see also in the command line. So as soon as we launch somewhere you might see okay when
3:41:16
launching the cluster they detected you are using
3:41:23
Mumbai and they know in the Mumbai there's three uh ages available
3:41:30
okay it means whatever work on node you are going to launch they will distribute
3:41:37
worker node in different different ages. So one of a goes down second worker node keep on running my entire load to be
3:41:43
managed by all the worker node running in second as
3:41:49
for this they always launch the worker node into the node group
3:41:56
by here they give a node group also a name is a random name but we can change our name accordingly
3:42:03
okay accordingly it means technically as a AWS perspective
3:42:10
Okay. Or EK service perspective. Node group is not a concept guys from Kubernetes cluster.
3:42:15
Cubic does not know about node group. It is a way AWS managing the instances or the worker node. But if you say if you
3:42:23
want to launch two instance okay or three instance but if you put
3:42:30
this instance let's say in node group number let's say ng node group number one. It means you're trying to tell you
3:42:37
you're trying to tell the AWS that because both this computer belong to same node group. So this is your duty.
3:42:46
You are planning okay to launch one in 1 A or launch second in 1B.
3:42:53
Okay, that's how we do. So point here is node group benefit. There more many more
3:42:58
benefit we'll see about node group in the future. It is a way we are grouping
3:43:06
the worker nodes. Okay. And this grouping is based on the similar type. If you have two or three
3:43:12
or four node with a same type of instance type or these node have same keys to login.
3:43:19
For example, SS keys. This system has same firewall to set up. This system has
3:43:25
some kind of range of IP address to give. Why? We will see in the future. Okay. So this also we can manage with
3:43:32
the node group. I'll show you how to customize this. Okay. But main thing about the node group I was talking about
3:43:38
is keeping two computer more than two computer in one group is a way to tell EKS
3:43:45
that there is now your responsibility go and think launch one in 1 A second one B
3:43:52
third in 1 C or and so on. Okay. So there's a N group is a facility by the
3:43:57
EKS. Okay. So you can see guys here they create a launch node group and as soon
3:44:06
as your instance come up. You can see uh by become using default command here.
3:44:12
In this default command what I show you from this website they are launching
3:44:20
two worker node only because both the worker node they're putting into one single node group. So you will see one
3:44:26
will launch in 1 A second will launch in 1 B or 1 C something like this automatically they manage four this is
3:44:32
just for the disaster recovery studies and the planning right okay that's one
3:44:38
thing okay uh so if you go to again my cluster page
3:44:47
even if I refresh it's still seven because they still launching it take some time in the cluster page that's
3:44:53
what you can see Here this is my cluster name
3:44:59
whatever they launch here and in this cluster uh in some time you will see in
3:45:05
the compute okay uh you in sometime you can see one node group created with the two
3:45:11
computers running it takes some time because they're still doing a lot of control plane they are uh they are
3:45:18
managing uh for us okay but I don't recommend guys this command right now
3:45:24
for you because this command use M5 L is not free. You pay a lot for
3:45:32
the worker node. Okay. So what you have to do you can customize the entire EKQL
3:45:38
command. That is what I'm going to show you here how we can customize.
3:45:44
Okay before this I want to show you one more small thing. I keep on running this command terminal. Let me open one more command terminal and ektl even though
3:45:52
let me go to same folder again otherwise same issue going to come up. I go to this folder.
3:45:59
Okay. Now ekctl uh there's a command called get cluster. It will tell you
3:46:05
also how many cluster you have in current region Mumbai. So you can see here EKCT is the one who created this
3:46:11
cluster in Mumbai. And this was the name given to us. Okay. So it's one cluster
3:46:17
we have and this cluster we launch with simple create command. Okay, they're still creating it.
3:46:24
Okay, but one more thing we can see here there's one more guys command called get
3:46:30
node group and one more one small thing guys to be
3:46:36
node this command is only for managing EKS service.
3:46:42
So anything with respect to EK service we can do from this command.
3:46:48
Okay. This command does not work because in in your account there might multiple
3:46:54
clusters. So they're asking you you want to see the node group of which cluster
3:47:00
cluster one cluster two. Okay. So that's what they're asking you
3:47:05
here. So I can say my cluster name is this one.
3:47:11
This is what the cluster name I want to see the things. And now what they're talking about
3:47:16
according to this cluster
3:47:23
we have this node group guys when we customize we can give anything we can give our own own name of
3:47:29
the node group own cluster name and status is they're still creating it. This node group is not created. And what
3:47:36
they creating? They're going to create instance of M5 large.
3:47:42
Okay. Of of capacity of two. Two means
3:47:48
uh they're launching two instances here. This got desired capacity.
3:47:54
But from the command line, we can scale also, increase, decrease also. But this is by default behavior they are doing
3:47:59
here. Okay. And who is creating Python? this script is creating for you.
3:48:05
So in some time even the cluster is active this active normally means your controller node is
3:48:11
active. Okay, but behind this controller node
3:48:17
they are launching now if you go to compute they're launching you can see guys node group now come up with the
3:48:23
desire two capacity means two worker node they launch and this worker node
3:48:29
we're going to launch a port or the container okay is we launched we want two okay if
3:48:38
you click on the node node is not up because now they're launching the node behind the scene who the script is
3:48:45
launching behind the scene. So that is the reason you're saying it is still
3:48:51
created but where they launch when the EC2 services it means if you go right
3:48:57
now to EC2 service I had seven instance initially now you can see it's become nine right
3:49:05
and if you notice here they launch this instance and this instance
3:49:12
this is the name of the instance okay if you notice this instance they
3:49:17
launch okay in 1A data center
3:49:23
okay and if you see the size of this instance
3:49:29
is M5 LS okay and second instance if you notice
3:49:34
this is in 1 A and this they are launching in 1B or 1 CCR 1 C so they
3:49:40
will do this plan because technically EC2 does not know about this but EKS
3:49:46
know These two node belong to same node group and everybody belong to same node group they will distribute in multiple
3:49:53
ages because of the disaster planning purpose that we always want right so
3:49:59
that's what happened behind the scene but they are running they are running uh
3:50:05
but uh running does not mean they are complete after the node completely run
3:50:12
then whatever the software we need in the node I explain to you in the node mode we need multiple softwares. So
3:50:19
they're launching the software setting the software after sort of done then we connect to the master register
3:50:26
then only your cluster is ready to use that is the reason guys this command is still working now I think it's done
3:50:33
right so finally when you see this output okay output your cluster is ready so it
3:50:41
take 15 20 minute around around to have your two nodes ready in this cluster and
3:50:48
And they give the cluster node IP address also host them also here which two node has been connected.
3:50:54
Okay. So this part is done. Now in interesting point is
3:51:02
you have a Kubernetes cluster ready. Now it does not matter
3:51:09
how you launched it. You manually launch it. You use EKS AKS GKE
3:51:16
tool. You use your vanilla whatever way you launch you have the cluster ready.
3:51:23
So who going to use this cluster? Your IT team. They connect this cluster and use it.
3:51:31
And for the IT team perspective, they are the user and they want to connect a
3:51:37
cluster. They also need a tool a command. Okay. Okay. And the Kubernetes
3:51:43
client or the user we have a command called cubectl is a kubernetes command
3:51:49
for the users. This command has no relation with AWS. Wherever you have the cubernetes same command going to use.
3:51:58
Okay. So if you want to use if you want to make your laptop as a user of the Kubernetes
3:52:04
cluster to use it you have to install this command here.
3:52:09
So um so this command again you can download from the internet cubectl
3:52:16
okay install for Windows Linux Mac you can find this command for all the OS and
3:52:21
if you notice that we download from cubernet website not from the AWS website right
3:52:28
and this command you can download from here I'm downloading from the windows so there's a command they give me here I'll
3:52:35
copy this command I'll go to my command line in the same folder. I'm keeping everything here in same folder. Hit and
3:52:43
this is downloaded guys. Fail uh right now is because of Windows. If I
3:52:51
try to download anything in the program file directly, it fail. So what you do? You can open your command line with the
3:52:57
run as administrator. Okay. and then go to this folder again
3:53:05
where you want to keep everything there's no compass you can keep any anywhere but I'm just trying to organize
3:53:10
my command in the same location and let me copy this command and run
3:53:19
okay I'm also sharing in this document so this is still here for the cluster
3:53:25
right now the role of user going to come in play so anyone who want to user or a
3:53:31
client also know the customer talking about the user of Kubernetes.
3:53:37
Okay, they need this software.
3:53:44
Okay, this software. So now I can see this software going to come up.
3:53:51
One more last thing we need obviously if you want as a user now technically if
3:53:56
you notice your cluster actually running in as cloud somewhere in EK service or
3:54:01
wherever they run does not matter okay if you are a user some running somewhere
3:54:07
sitting somewhere if you want to connect to Kubernetes what you need minimum requirement you need is the IP address
3:54:13
of what your master computer secondly you need the username third you need the password
3:54:20
just to authenticate, right? So you as a Q user, you have to first authenticate before you use.
3:54:27
Okay, interesting thing is all these three things. Okay, your EKC command while installing
3:54:34
the cluster downloaded in your local Windows. How I know this?
3:54:40
So while running this command, okay, in the last line if you notice,
3:54:49
okay, this is the file they create in local windows. This is the file for your actual IT guys
3:54:57
or your client or the user of your Kubernetes. They say wherever your cubit is running
3:55:03
your master node details, the IP address, login and password, I keep in this file.
3:55:10
and get this is normal know cube config file and this is a default file used by your cube command
3:55:18
okay so technically you don't have to do anything okay in your local computer
3:55:25
your cube config file that contain your credentials for login to the cluster is
3:55:31
already been copied yeah if you want to login other computer
3:55:37
then this file you have to copy another computer or maybe in the Kubernetes I'll show you we can also
3:55:43
create our own accounts also so we can give that login and password to other team member they can log into Kubernetes
3:55:52
okay so my point is if you treating yourself as it operation guys
3:55:58
you want to use a cubic cluster now does not matter who launch EK or whoever launch does not matter okay in case EKS
3:56:05
launch but does not matter if you want to use it two things you need this command and this file. This file I
3:56:11
already have automatically copied here and we need this command cubectl. Now this is the command. This is a main
3:56:17
command guys. Okay. And this is the command through
3:56:24
which we can manage our entire Kubernetes. So we are explaining to you
3:56:31
uh in this last diagrams if you want to send any instructions to
3:56:37
the kubernetes okay that I want to launch this application you know this one right so I
3:56:43
am I am the one who want to launch the applications so how you send this instruction to the master node or to cluster via the user with the help of
3:56:50
cube cl command okay how we send I'll tell you but one
3:56:57
of the simple thing we can do with cube Ctl we can ask this command okay this
3:57:02
command will contact to cluster and say I want to get something what I want to get I want to see how many nodes we have
3:57:10
okay again I repeating guys after this there's no role of EKS as such right now
3:57:18
okay right now we as a user directly connecting to the kubernetes cluster so
3:57:25
whatever you know kubernetes till date and whatever you will know everything you can run with the cubectl command and
3:57:31
I know this command will tell you that in your cluster right now you have two nodes you know these are the two nodes
3:57:38
who launch ease launch who manage ease manage everything is done by ease but technically this command will tell you
3:57:44
also how many nodes you have here okay you have here but we know this node
3:57:52
behind the scene is is uh running in the EC2
3:58:00
that you don't have to manage by yourself but EC2 if you notice also this node is having the the the
3:58:08
IP address right so 20589 205 uh actually this a private IP
3:58:16
they're showing you so it does not showing you yeah here it is
3:58:22
2527 this is the one of the node they're talking about
3:58:27
Okay. Initially when we learn the this EKS and thing together sometime we got
3:58:34
confused I want to quickly tell you whenever you want to do anything in with
3:58:40
the EKS service then we use this command okay to delete the cluster add more node
3:58:48
that what EKS duty but inside the cluster if you want to do anything
3:58:54
that is the most the user of the cubes will do we use cubectl command like get nodes command.
3:59:01
Okay, this is what they do. So this is one thing. So guys, what I'm
3:59:06
going to do very quickly, I want to delete this cluster. I want to connect the cluster one more time very quickly
3:59:12
in the better way and then I'll show you some demonstration on the top of this cluster. How to launch a container app
3:59:18
and then I'll show you the power of running cubernainers with EKS. That's
3:59:24
what I haven't tell you discussed till now. Okay, because the beautiful thing is EKS give you very high powerful
3:59:31
connectivity with the internal services that is very harder if you run your vanilla cubernetes your own then
3:59:38
integrating with AWS other services with Kubernetes like EBS service or load balancer service or IM service is very
3:59:46
harder we can do it but very harder but here they give all the pre-integration whatever we need Kubernetes cluster with
3:59:54
the EK ser cloud services. What I mean by this, I'll tell you in a minute.
4:00:01
Only thing I'm doing right now is okay if I want to do something with EKS. So I
4:00:06
can use EK STL. This is the clusters we have right now. Okay, I would like to
4:00:13
quickly delete this because my intent is not to use this. Just want to show you by chance. If you want have a
4:00:19
requirement very quickly launch, you just launch it with get uh create command. But I want to delete this cluster. They're asking you to give the
4:00:26
name. So I'm giving the name. This is the cluster I want to delete. So entire
4:00:31
setup what I launch that will delete it. Okay. It take again some second to a minute to delete. Okay. Now what the
4:00:39
best way to to um
4:00:44
launch the cluster. Okay. So again I'm going to the same folder where I have all the commands.
4:00:51
And if you want to launch e cluster with EKS
4:00:56
okay we don't go for by default setting what we will do okay I will create one
4:01:05
file here we customize and we write in the file so let's say I'm going to write a create a file setup dot some name yml
4:01:12
file just extension I'm giving here okay and let's say my my setup or my cluster
4:01:19
setup Okay. So file name given why I'm giving this
4:01:25
because my plan is I want to give my cluster my own name. Let's say my test cluster.
4:01:33
I want to give my node group my own name. Let's say my name of my node group is my node group one.
4:01:42
And in this node group, I want to launch three nodes
4:01:48
with T2 micro. This is what I want.
4:01:54
Even though I can launch one more node group, node group number two. Here I can launch
4:02:00
two nodes with let's say T2 small
4:02:06
mean this has a 1 GB RAM. This might have one or two GB RAM for CPU one or two.
4:02:13
Okay. So point is point is ekctl command. What are you using right now?
4:02:18
That's what I'm going to use. But in the command line of EKCTL,
4:02:24
EKSCTL, okay, they give you option to directly
4:02:31
create a by default cluster that might not mostly useful as such. But this
4:02:36
command will also give you option rather than you create a cluster the way I create here
4:02:44
cluster directly by before setting. Okay, rather create a cluster in this
4:02:50
way. What can you do? If you see the help of this command have an H.
4:02:55
They say rather new cluster in this way.
4:03:00
Okay, by default what can you do? You can pass one file. So if you notice here,
4:03:06
they give you option here uh format.
4:03:13
There's option here to pass one file. There's f option here. You can see
4:03:18
somewhere here or somewhere. The point is
4:03:23
what I'm trying to tell you here is uh with this command we can customize our own cluster.
4:03:30
Master we can customize. Master is internal. It's fully managed serverless kind of. Okay. Worker node we decide how
4:03:38
many worker need we need and all the things we can decide here. Okay. How?
4:03:45
Either in this command line there's options here we can pass. I want to get my cluster name. I want to put in
4:03:51
different zone. I want to use uh node group name this one. I want to use node
4:03:59
have this one. Let me let me use this command very quickly right or or maybe
4:04:05
you can you can create this command. But mostly what we want to do same thing I can put in the file and this file is
4:04:12
normally known as WL file or the setting file or the config file for a cluster
4:04:18
for EKCTL where we to keep this kind of entry.
4:04:24
Okay. So actual syntax is not this one. I just want to tell you this is what we have to write. Excel syntax of this file
4:04:31
you can get from the EKS EKS ctl website. If you go down
4:04:38
either you can use this command they I showed to you or you can pass this kind
4:04:43
of file the file that I was trying to create here and this file syntax is actually look
4:04:50
like this. So let me copy this entire syntax as it is. Okay. and let me update
4:04:58
where there uh you can give your cluster name. Let's say according to my requirement I want to give my cluster my
4:05:04
test cluster. This is my cluster name. I want to launch in a region called AP
4:05:10
South one. I want to launch a node groups.
4:05:16
So how many node group is a list? This hyphen means list. This first node group and this second nodes group. Let's say
4:05:23
this node group I might launch for uh small
4:05:29
uh node group. I'm just giving a name for small workload. Okay, there's a node group creator for
4:05:36
bigger workload. What a name you want to give you can give. Okay, here I want to give
4:05:42
a instance type called T2 micro. Obviously T micro might not be so much
4:05:47
useful in the real world but I'm we just trying to save the money. And here in
4:05:52
this node I want three worker node to work.
4:05:58
And here I might go for T2 small for example. And here I want to launch two.
4:06:05
Interesting thing is now you might understand what is node group. This is a node group name. Node group means it's a
4:06:12
group of node. Here we have three nodes or three worker node having the same capacity.
4:06:19
Second benefit of node group is if you put this three node in one node group. So ease will take a sure we give you the
4:06:26
guarantee that they are um they will launch this node
4:06:33
group in different different ages. Okay. Now this is different node group.
4:06:39
Okay. So in one cluster this cluster name you have given in Mumbai
4:06:45
you can launch as many as node group with different different planning different different requirement
4:06:51
okay so this is this is information about the worker node and that is reason why we don't use the word worker node is
4:06:58
manage node right everything they will configure for you register for you in
4:07:03
the cluster setting for you or I can say launch for you but what you looking for
4:07:10
you have to decide so something you to decide according to requirement
4:07:16
that is reason whole EK service is not fully managed or is not serverless
4:07:21
but if you want to if you want everything will be fully managed you don't have to tell also this part also then in my coming advanced discussion of
4:07:27
EKS I'll talk of fargget we will make that power from the farget that
4:07:34
makes the EKS server less okay so That
4:07:39
is what we have decided here in this two means now these two instances will launch but one will launch in 1 A 1 B.
4:07:46
So this node is a different ground group is a different node group. Maybe they belong to same cluster
4:07:52
but this is we are organizing our different different worker node or the slave node
4:07:58
and this file is meant for EKS command CL that's what we write here and this
4:08:04
file is meant for kind means what we are doing here cluster config like setting up the cluster
4:08:11
okay otherwise we can go more deep into this file lots of settings we can do for
4:08:17
the cluster and the worker node and the node group as we progress I'll talk about it okay but this is a better
4:08:25
way to manage it right so what I'm going to do this file I'm going to run same
4:08:31
command ekctl I want to create my cluster by this command they will
4:08:39
launch by default cluster instead I have a file this my cluster yl file if I hit
4:08:47
enter Now it will see here guys here they are going to launch two node group.
4:08:54
This is what the name we have given. They're going to give cluster name my
4:09:00
test cluster. This is what name we have given. And if you go to your page of the
4:09:05
cluster you can see refresh
4:09:10
uh why this name was coming. I think we removed already right. Actually remove
4:09:17
is not done yet. If you see remove part is not yet done is is still working but this name also you can see come up here.
4:09:25
Okay. So that's what so this is how we customize this. Otherwise, we go more
4:09:31
deep into this file. But I highly suggest
4:09:37
whenever you want to launch a cubernetes cluster, uh this is a file you can use
4:09:44
to launch and customize your cluster. Okay, again take 20 minutes around 20 15
4:09:50
20 minutes to have this cluster. But yeah, after the cluster is done has been launched,
4:09:57
then I'll show you how to use Kubernetes. Again, I I'll show you in a
4:10:02
way that you does not require any Kubernetes knowledge. My intention is not to train you in the Kubernetes as
4:10:09
such. Okay. But my intention is to show you that if you know Kubernetes or if
4:10:15
you will know Kubernetes in the future I'll tell you what minimum requirement in my next discussion right interesting
4:10:22
thing is okay Kubernetes highly
4:10:28
associated with AWS other services. One thing you can see here right I use
4:10:35
EK EK EKS services and they launch in EC2 and they know they are launching
4:10:42
here and they also register this instances otherwise whenever whenever we need any
4:10:48
load balancer in my cubernetes cluster they will use the one
4:10:53
very famous load balancer from as cloud called ELB load balancers
4:11:01
or NLB or ELB whatever you have okay whenever you need uh volume they take
4:11:06
from here when they want to back up they use snapshot and for this you don't need to know any
4:11:12
of these commands or any EBS also right everything you can do from the
4:11:18
Kubernetes your Kubernetes command the typical command that is working everywhere other
4:11:25
Kubernetes version also and the platform also same command you use here but behind the scene They integrated with
4:11:33
all the services already. Okay. And you can utilize the entire power of AWS. My
4:11:39
point is simple is okay. From the Kubernetes
4:11:45
cloud, okay, you can able to utilize the entire
4:11:51
power of AWS for what whatever the purpose you want to use Kubernetes for.
4:11:58
Right? This is what I'm trying to tell you. So in my demonstration I'll show you uh how you guys can use.
4:12:07
Okay I take again 20 minutes. So how to use this cluster and according to me is
4:12:13
one of the very very very fascinating and interesting demos I would like to show you tomorrow where I start
4:12:19
explaining you how to use this command. Okay. Plus we'll go more deep into this
4:12:27
file tomorrow. So I suggest guys till here have this cluster ready try to
4:12:34
launch a cluster with this okay and after launch just check cluster launch
4:12:40
or not that's all okay those who know kubernetes they can try and put their
4:12:46
skills on the cubain try it whatever you know in the cubernetes otherwise if you don't know does not matter and tomorrow
4:12:52
I will explain you all the minimum requirement how to launch a port application scaling load balances
4:12:59
lots of thing we will discuss as we progress right so I would like to conclude guys we plan actually today for
4:13:05
around 3 hour but it's like four hour been done but yeah uh at least a lot of information uh we have collected today
4:13:13
right tomorrow would be the core purely discussion on EKS background what you
4:13:18
need to know about a uh cubernetes I explained to you tomorrow would be purely on EKS and Kubernetes respective
4:13:25
discussion and with the practicals So that's all.
4:13:31
Okay. So uh that's all guys from my side. It will obviously launch in some
4:13:36
minute. Any doubt if you have any query if you have guys you guys can ask otherwise we conclude today's class and
4:13:43
continue from here in tomorrow to Sunday again we see you guys at 2:00 tomorrow
4:13:49
right? So any question any doubt if you have you guys can ask me.
4:13:56
uh this class uh would be on EKS class
4:14:01
would be on weekend only Saturday Sunday okay plus whoever right now in the
4:14:08
advancing also is also weekend okay because EK is also part of advanced
4:14:14
architecting and serverless guys also in weekend Okay.
4:14:27
So, uh Mohammed tomorrow after this EKS cluster launch, I'll perform lots of
4:14:32
demonstration on the top of the some of the idea I show you already today. Our moto is to launch the app in such a way
4:14:41
they launch very quickly. Second, I want to manage fault tolerance. That's what we always want. There's some basic use
4:14:48
case I told you today that I'll show you tomorrow how can we see it but there many more use cases what EKS and
4:14:55
Kubernetes will perform for you okay that is the reason why we need in real world a lot so I can show you with a
4:15:02
practical that what we'll do tomorrow right so I'll cover it tomorrow
4:15:11
yes uh I I suggest uh guys if you are uh if you are launching ing the cluster for
4:15:17
testing delete it otherwise they charge you per hour how to delete I'll tell you the command
4:15:24
okay so you can again an ekctl get cluster you can get the cluster name
4:15:31
okay this is all the cluster we are launching right now and to delete instead of get you can use delete
4:15:36
command and then you can type the name of the cluster
4:15:42
this one it again take some minute it will delete for
4:15:47
Okay. So launch it, test it. Okay. Run some cubectl get node command at least
4:15:54
if you don't know anything much. If you're running then uh delete this.
4:16:00
Okay. So I highly suggest otherwise you get a bill in your counter.
4:16:17
So uh if if guys the theory that I explained to you only intention what go
4:16:22
you also asking only intention to give you some vocabulary about the cubidities otherwise
4:16:29
uh if you think some of the vocabulary you did not understand that doesn't matter right when we uh go for
4:16:36
demonstration everything will again come up and when you see things practically happening um then you become very much
4:16:43
very much comfortable about this topic. My intention is to just start the story
4:16:48
uh so that uh you know what is Kubernetes and then also you know why we need EKS. But don't worry the entire
4:16:55
story and theory I covered today will be again
4:17:01
u demonstrated with a practical and then you get more clarity and more confidence
4:17:06
on the concept. So tomorrow class is very important what I'm talking talking about pure demonstration a lot of use
4:17:11
case we're going to implement there
4:17:18
so uh satisfy satisfy from the lecture get a good idea of PVC yes uh Anuz will talk about uh PVC and you see guys now
4:17:25
PVC is highly attached to EBS you don't have to do much uh in my
4:17:31
tomorrow class I'll talk about it
4:17:36
so on what basis selection for summer intensive program will be. Uh so wet you
4:17:41
come to know soon you just apply on the form for summer uh in the in our the
4:17:47
creator website.
4:17:54
Do we get the recording for these classes? Sam will let you know we I we always suggest to have this u live
4:18:03
classes otherwise my team will create one reference document for you. You can refer it. Okay. Tomorrow again before we
4:18:11
start the class we again revise what we discussed today and plus in the practical part tomorrow everything again
4:18:17
practically demonstrated. So uh so I'm not sure about the recording uh but if
4:18:23
if you by chance miss due to some reason we can also you send the request we'll definitely give you that's a different
4:18:29
point. What benefit note group providers I think Anur Anura I explained you okay I
4:18:37
already explained to you but I give you more example tomorrow you will get the idea. Okay, a node group will uh just
4:18:45
very quick in one line. Node group is a way through which I'll tell my AWS
4:18:52
that I want three instances of same type. Okay, this is one of the benefit. Second
4:18:59
thing is when I launch three now this is your responsibility because they belong to one node group. So you distribute in
4:19:05
different different ages. Why? You know because if some a goes down so at least
4:19:11
other a running so your service won't be down okay
4:19:20
sir uh will we discuss uh pervat st is very very important topic service mass
4:19:26
is not a part of this program but we have launched very advanced training of stom mass is official training from
4:19:34
reddit also with global exam certification So that training you can join but yeah in here we are not going to discuss our
4:19:41
hto and service mass it was wonderful session really great to
4:19:46
have a student of you thank you others
4:19:52
my message visible to you uh let me see it if you uh
4:20:00
okay uh in our as cloud enable program after completion can I get go through as
4:20:05
CSA say uh no actually sudasan uh AWCSA
4:20:11
examination contain lot many more topics okay uh so enablement program will give
4:20:18
you a kickstart in AWS but does not complete everything about CSA okay so uh
4:20:25
don't go directly uh otherwise you face the challenge over Yeah.
4:20:44
So fuse would there are a class on HF for a port based on node
4:20:50
a single node in a single node but different instances uh fuse uh I'm not able to understand if
4:20:57
you can again reframe it. Okay, what exactly you asking? I will definitely help you. Uh guys, whatever the drawing
4:21:04
I created today, this screen source, everything will be posted in one Google
4:21:09
drive. That Google Drive link will share to you. Plus, my team also created a proper step-by-step notes of the today's
4:21:17
entire class. Okay, that reference document also we provide by to you soon.
4:21:22
Maybe do it day or two days, we'll provide to you, right? So, that can be your reference note for further
4:21:27
practice. H
4:21:36
uh so others yes you can manage staging and process environment in EKS I give a way how we can do so okay
4:21:48
can we use private subnet in EKS cluster yes uh Anika you can manage the private subnet also in EKS cluster uh for this
4:21:57
we when I go for more deep discuss on this file here we will uh we will write
4:22:04
something okay so we can decide also our subnets and VPCs and many more things so
4:22:11
answer yes you can do anything and everything you can customize with respect to your worker nodes by this
4:22:18
file
4:22:30
uh great sensor but I also think about 2 hours session is too much I I understand Goro but I also feel uh by chance today
4:22:36
there's a lot of theories so it look like sometime overwhelming but when we go for the demonstration pass
4:22:42
demonstration practical time very quickly goes so but we'll try to cover
4:22:50
this string in um in some limited hours
4:22:55
let's say 3 hours tomorrow right we'll try
4:23:02
yes uh Anika we will cover a gateway as ingress in e training right so uh I
4:23:08
think you're talking about the internet gateway or right so that will be used and seen tomorrow maybe as ingress uh in
4:23:16
your that is sending the traffic to a mode. I think this is what you're talking about. Okay. Because a lot of
4:23:21
things we can do within Chris control I can say but yeah if you're talking about
4:23:26
internet gateway send a traffic directly to the port and
4:23:32
and uh and via ALB or NLPs. So yeah this
4:23:37
was kind of practical we'll see tomorrow.
4:23:44
No uh Anus uh here there's no role of global accelerator
4:23:51
okay has no meaning on it okay because global accelerator we use
4:23:58
in AWS for um for
4:24:03
uh uh you know if you part of my training of uh AWS I explained that but
4:24:09
it is meant if you have uh any application running in one region here
4:24:15
and if somebody want to use another region so very quickly if you want to
4:24:20
send the data or get the connections so we use uh AWS private internet private
4:24:26
global network there of global accelator come in play okay so there's no meaning of
4:24:35
e EKS with global accelator but yeah when we launch our application that we want we can host with EKS sorry
4:24:42
with the global accelator what I mean by this tomorrow I will keep the idea again
4:24:48
uh a global accelerator and the cloud fund is is looks somehow but it's not somehow uh it's not same or similar is
4:24:55
very different thing so uh if you right now as a part of current training that's going on a CSA global I explained to you
4:25:02
in upcoming class when I go for cloud front I will give you the
4:25:08
the uh quick difference the big difference between these two Okay,
4:25:15
hersel this training is only EKS. So we are not planning for go for ECS
4:25:20
but whatever we need for EKS to know EKS pate
4:25:26
maybe because so Helm chart and any other component carpenter so those thing
4:25:32
we will discuss ECS uh in this EKS training we won't discuss
4:25:41
so yeah if you're part of CSA training or AWS advanced architecting we have a
4:25:46
discussion on ECA is in those that part of part but only in this EK training is not
4:25:54
okay. So that's all guys. Uh
4:25:59
have this revise this. We'll provide quickly this uh revision document to
4:26:04
you. Uh revise this. Technically nothing one big command to perform only just to
4:26:10
launch it. This is this file and the command. So it will launch and finally
4:26:17
it might be launched for us. It is still working running but they are launching soon. Okay. So that's it from my side guys.
4:26:25
See you. Uh Mayor you asked me something. Uh I
4:26:31
haven't seen your question. If you again ask Mayor what you're asking.
4:26:39
I'm not able to see your question. Mayor
4:26:45
I'm searching actually a lot of queries there no training I told you is uh when is
4:26:52
training is starting well we'll I'll let you know guys we already out the training
4:26:57
uh uh training and uh most probably within a one week or two week we are
4:27:03
planning to start start training right so we'll update you guys soon in your group about this one and this training
4:27:10
is a is a complete global training because this is official
4:27:17
premium product of Red Hat. Uh so uh so if you search for Red Hat uh Studio
4:27:26
Service mass training so this is the training uh we
4:27:33
are launching we launched already. Okay. And this is one of the premium
4:27:38
product with exam also included. And we try to make this training as much
4:27:44
as affordable. Actual price is very high actually if you just talk to red hat and
4:27:50
maybe somewhere in the market. But we try to make this training as much as uh
4:27:55
affordable so that you guys can learn this entire concept plus
4:28:01
go for global examination also. Okay. So soon we are going to start let's try.
4:28:12
So that's all and then finally I would like to open this file again and this is the command line tool. Uh so command
4:28:19
that I used to launch is this one uh is this one
4:28:26
f and then your file name. Whatever file you created this is the command I use.
4:28:32
Okay. So that's it guys. Uh
4:28:41
so man said do you please less fees for is too high? Um actually Manish believe
4:28:47
me is actually very high according to Red Hat. Uh but uh but we make it we
4:28:56
make it very very comffortable. Right. But we'll see. We'll we'll trying what
4:29:01
else we can do more on it.
4:29:06
Yes, that's also we can do uh uh we can launch some node in Mumbai some other
4:29:12
region and how all those customization can be done we will see by this file.
4:29:19
Okay. So next wait for next class I'll show you many more customization in this
4:29:24
file to be that can be done. Okay. So that's all guys. See you tomorrow
4:29:31
2:00 afternoon IST time and we'll go to next level. Bye. Good day and take care.
