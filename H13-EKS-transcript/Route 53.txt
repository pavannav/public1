ript


5:07
All right guys, uh so welcome back. Uh one more please let me connect my
5:14
devices. Okay. U so uh we have uh some more new topic guys in this u process of
5:23
uh uh AWS training. So um so uh in last class guys uh we
5:31
have uh discussed about autoscaling or I can say autoscaling group and I explain
5:38
you how to uh uh use EC2 instances or
5:43
how to um uh you know how to use some kind of uh automate u you know strategy
5:52
or policy you can use uh if you want to scale uh your instance es uh as per the
5:59
load increase or some more decision we can uh we can put over there. Okay. So a
6:04
lot of thing about um autoscaling group we had discussed in my last class some
6:10
more practical will come up about the autoscaling in my future classes uh
6:15
where some kind of specific use case uh for the autoscaling come up. Okay. Plus
6:21
uh last week uh we also have um uh discussed a lot of thing about RDS.
6:26
Okay. So if you have a requirement for the SQL services or RDB RDBM uh BBS
6:35
RDBMS RDBS service services um then uh we have to go for RDS uh
6:44
service. Okay. But uh those who by chance don't know what is RDBMS
6:51
or SQL kind of services maybe my in my upcoming classes when I talk about uh
6:57
NoSQL there I can again uh give you a difference between what SQL do for you
7:05
and what SQL doesn't do for you and why we need to go for NoSQL. Okay.
7:12
So we'll discuss on those classes but in the RDS services we have
7:18
discussed about read replica use case of the read replica high aability and some
7:24
more uh concept about RDS we had discussed. Okay. So today's guys uh if
7:30
you um for today's plan uh one
7:41
so uh today uh I uh I would like to start a very new uh service uh name of
7:47
the service is route 53. Okay. And by chance if we got the time
7:53
today there might might not be possible but if we got get the time today or maybe tomorrow I will start one uh
8:00
service that is a different service obviously. Uh so name of service is called global accelerator
8:07
accelerator. Okay. So again very interesting service some kind of new new
8:13
service in uh the AWS and u anybody who want to appear for the global exam for
8:21
uh AWS CSA examination right so from the latest paper of 2020 or maybe 2021 they also
8:29
add some more thing so this is one new topic they had uh they have added in
8:34
your program very interesting service very powerful service we will discuss. So maybe today or tomorrow I will talk
8:41
about what is global accelator and how it is different from route 53 and how it
8:48
is different from uh cloud front. So what is cloud fun? Uh we had already
8:55
discussed but again you will see very quick summary again one more time uh tomorrow when I start the global
9:01
accelerate. Okay. So to uh today guys the main plan uh and main time we are
9:08
going to spend on route 53. Okay. And I also believe uh you guys uh most of the
9:14
guys are very new in the networking world or maybe there might be possibility
9:20
might be possibility you guys are not uh so much comfortable with DNS.
9:26
Okay. So route 53 is just a managed services for the DNS server. Okay. So if
9:33
you want to work on u uh want to work on route 53 then you should be very much
9:39
comfortable with some of the concept of the DNS and and the use cases of the
9:44
DNS. Okay. So I just want to in in spend some time on the very basics concept of
9:52
the DNS plus some more advanced concept of DNS also because for lot of guys
9:59
might think a lot of guys might think DNS is just only used to convert your name or host
10:07
name or domain name into the IP address. Okay. So but DNS is not only for
10:14
converting the name into the IP address. This this is one of the core duty of the
10:20
DNS otherwise uh which is very powerful thing DNS using the DNS tons of extra things or
10:28
extra facilities they provide to us. Okay. So let me start with uh this
10:33
particular concept. So my plan is to first give you maybe half of the today's class might go um and talking about the
10:42
concepts of the DNS. Okay. So yeah by chance in the AWS training like we are
10:49
into the AWS CSA or the developer track it has been considered that you guys has
10:55
a prerequisite that you guys know already DNS and actually we have to move to Route 53 to configure this service
11:04
but but I I told you maybe we think we might know but there might be a lot of
11:09
use case also that DNS can do for you that mostly or most of times we might don't
11:15
Okay. So let me start with this use case then I will start discussing about the DNS. Okay. So today's um the process
11:23
would be I'll start with the DNS then we'll slowly move to a managed service of DNS called route 53 then global
11:31
accelator. This is the uh agenda for today or maybe for tomorrow. Okay. So let me start from here. Okay.
11:39
Uh everybody know here what is the load balancer? Because about the load balancer we discussed hell lot. So
11:46
there's three different kind of load balancer we discussed ALB ALB NLB and uh
11:51
CLB. But if you talk about at the high level the use case of a load balancer is
11:57
uh is pretty same. Okay. So use case of load balancer is if you have one of the
12:03
instances running let's say EC2 instance and due to some of the reason right if
12:09
the load increase okay I don't want you know my client will wait for uh for this
12:16
applications to to serve to us uh we will launch one more instance here
12:23
one more instance here and uh my load balancer uh my ELB will balance the load
12:30
Okay, this is one of the duty of load balancer. But there one more duty of the load balancer is whenever guys you
12:35
configure any of the load balancer like here ELB we have. Okay, ELB we have. So
12:42
they also do one more thing for us. they keep on doing the health uh checking and
12:48
one of the good thing about the health checking is uh uh your load balancer will automatically come to know that you
12:54
have one backend system let's say IP1 goes down because they know it goes down
12:59
uh so now uh any request come up in the future the the load balancers keep on sending and getting the service from IP
13:07
number two for example so this is again wise guys one more benefit your uh
13:13
elastic load balancer uh will provide to you. Okay. So it is like a fail
13:19
something fail IP one fail the automate detected with the help of hell checks
13:26
and uh they will connect uh the next request to IP number two or maybe you have more backend system running IP
13:32
number three they connect to IP number three. Okay. So till here you guys know and uh I have shown this uh demo and
13:39
practical also to you. Okay. And now the point here is right what if and this is
13:45
a very common queries almost everybody think if they really do this practical
13:51
right and always they ask what if your entire elastic load balancer goes down
13:57
because technically if you ask to the AWS and ask what is the ELB so they say
14:05
ELB is just um uh one device
14:10
because there are lot of devices available in the market or also known as appliances that will provide you um
14:17
facility of uh load balancers or maybe there are lot of lot of programs and software also available. They provide
14:23
you a facility of load balance but program guys can cor crash any point in
14:28
time device maybe goes down or maybe corrupt maybe at at
14:35
any point in time. So if you ask AWS can you provide me can you please tell
14:42
me u the durability of this device okay does this device or this program would
14:47
be 100% durable or can you provide the high availability of this device does
14:53
this device is always be available so nobody guys in the world even though the cloud like AWS and
15:01
Google has a one of the biggest infrastructure in um in the globe right
15:07
but even though they will also not give you the 100% guarantee okay so they any
15:13
point in time this device or this program uh may go strong and we guys know um the client
15:20
client is always uh always connect to the endpoint or the IP of the ELB and
15:28
obviously if ALB goes down or maybe wherever we running this ALB we we have
15:33
to run the ALB in one of the EG or one of the data center let's say one E data
15:39
center okay if the entire data center cools down so no none of the company going to going to help us in this kind
15:45
of uh disaster so as a good disaster uh plan or disaster uh recovery strategies
15:53
what we have to do so the good plan always say
15:58
always create at least two elastic load tensors
16:04
two elastic elastic load balances or maybe three elastic load balances. Okay. And um and obviously they put uh some
16:11
instance behind uh this guy. So let's say this IP 4, this IP5 and this IP6 and
16:18
if somebody connect to this uh instances we connect uh this guy to these instance or maybe you can ask this elastic
16:25
balancer to connect to these instance also like this and these guys connect to these instances. So all the front end
16:34
load balances is connected to the back end all the
16:39
back end uh server but why we launch uh multiple backend system to balance the
16:45
load or something fail. So my load load balancer will tackle this part with the help of hell check but why we launch two
16:52
elastic load balancer let's say uh one of the IP of the load balancer is IP and one of the IP of the load balancer is IP
16:59
200. So why we launched to load balancer and guys this part we have to even
17:05
though Amazon say they are launching multiple load balancer behind the scene to give
17:11
you capability of uh durability. So that's what they they're talking about
17:17
they say this is the manage service of the load balancer. So I will take care about the management of the load
17:23
balancer. You don't have to worry about you don't have to worry about to create
17:29
two load balancer by yourself but okay but they create only pergs
17:36
okay or they are not giving a 100% guarantee but they might be requirement you want to create a load balancer that
17:43
will balance the load across the region so what I mean by this we will uh guys we will we will talk about uh this point
17:51
but main point is If you say no, I am not pretty
17:58
sure about uh the facilities provided by the load balancer management by the AWS.
18:06
Any point in time this device goes down. So I will manually self launch one more load balancer. Now point is here here
18:13
guys. Now we have two load balancers. Okay. And why you launch? You guys will
18:20
discuss one of the goes down my client will come to second one but in this case client has to remember two IP addresses
18:28
IP 100 and IP 200 and that is guys one of the reason why we introduce reverse proxy okay because
18:37
client don't have to remember two IP or maybe three load balancer you launch or three IP address so what uh client do
18:43
client first type IP if the load balancer is working great uh they uh
18:50
give the reply back to the client but maybe this point in time this load
18:55
balancer is down so client has to manually type in the browser IP 200 and connect to this load balancer. So this
19:02
facility obviously guys is not good for a good user experience for the client.
19:08
Okay. So technically we want a program again one more program between the
19:13
client and between the load balances. Okay. It is exactly same what we discussed in my load benching classes.
19:20
So between these computers my client don't have to type IP one by one to all the instances. Okay. Which
19:27
one is down? Which is up? Which has a proper
19:32
which one is ready to uh reply on my request. So we add one program called load balancer. Now same kind of scenario
19:39
again come up here. Now we have multiple load balancer and we have a client and I
19:45
want my client don't remember all the IP and manual type one by one all the IP.
19:50
So we have to add one more program between the client and uh uh between the
19:57
uh load balance and the beauty of this program is same thing we'll tell this program that you have two backend system
20:06
now by chance these two back end system is IP 100 IP 200 by chance they are load balancers you but you have two backend
20:12
uh servers okay they're running on some port number and when we whenever anybody reach to this that guy uh that back you
20:20
will uh you'll get your reply whatever request you have. So again this program
20:27
this is program is helping to do a load balancing but this time this program is
20:32
doing the load balancing in the back end system and that back end system is elastic load balancer or maybe any other
20:37
load balanc so maybe maybe some kind of other instances also but typically this kind of setup we can uh we can uh
20:44
provide. Okay. And you know the good thing about this program is maybe somebody might ask and this is a very
20:51
common query. Somebody might ask what if if this program goes down.
20:56
Okay. So who will manage uh the further fail over? Okay. So answer is guys you
21:03
know what you know what this program never goes down. Okay. the the the
21:08
program that is created in such a way okay this particular program I'm talking
21:13
about who helping to balance the load between uh multiple load balancer this
21:20
program guys never goes down this program goes down when you internet goes
21:26
down you can think in this way and if you ask do you think internet goes down answer
21:33
is no maybe our internet goes down at our home at our office but I'm talking about the overall global internet. Okay.
21:40
Does the global internet goes down? Uh as such no same thing you can say here.
21:46
Uh because our internet is somehow
21:51
mostly based on this program. Everywhere we use this program. Okay. So this
21:56
program is so much uh interesting, so much powerful in the terms of durability. It never goes down. Why? We
22:04
will discuss today. So name of this program who helping me to balance the
22:09
load between multiple instances or here in this case multiple load balancer. The
22:14
name of this program is called DNS domain name uh system. Okay. So I know a
22:21
lot of guys know about DNS but but DNS one of the use case of the DNS is you
22:26
can use DNS for load balancing also. This is one of the feature of DNS. Okay.
22:33
Otherwise there's lots other feature of the DNS also. We are going to discuss multiple features about DNS in the
22:40
today's class. Okay. And this is the actual infrastructure normally used by
22:48
other company. If you go to facebook.com, if you go to google.com, all right, you always hit to the load
22:54
balancer provided by the DNS of Google or provided by DNS server of the Amazon of
23:01
the of the Facebook or XYZ. you always hit to the load balancer and that load balancer will connect to uh multiple
23:09
computer working behind the Google DNS server and all those computer what is working behind are the Google DN or the
23:16
Amazon or Facebook load balancer and behind the load balancer there are they
23:21
may be running millions and thousands and thousands of devices to serve you. What I mean by this we will we guys
23:28
create this entire scenario. Okay. So if you have this kind of use case who will
23:33
balance the load between the multiple load balancer here the ELB okay then DNS
23:40
is the final one who will balance the load and technically DNS is one kind of program or one kind of server it will
23:46
never go stop okay it will the it will be live there till the time internet is
23:51
live in the world you can think in this way why for this you have to understand the DNS first so guys we will again come
23:58
back to this topic or this particular use is in a minute. Okay. But before this, I just want to explain you some
24:05
more basics concept about the DNS. Okay. To to think in a mind that most of you
24:12
guys are very much new in the DNS. So let's start with the first topic today.
24:18
What is DNS? Okay. So you can think in this way. If
24:25
you one computer want to connect to second computer right in the internet or normal network we always use the IP
24:32
address okay we always use the IP address but sometime guys
24:38
because let's say this is a computer or this is B computer and if A want to connect to B uh the only challenge is A
24:46
have to remember the IP address of the B okay computer only understand the IP
24:52
address you can think in this way uh for the connectivity. Okay. But it's not
24:57
about to A have to remember only B IP address. A has to maybe remember hundreds of IP address of different
25:03
different computers. So what can we do? We can do one small U management here
25:10
that it is the same management that you do in your mobile phone also. And normally guys we don't if you dial a
25:16
call mobile number from one mobile to second mobile number. Uh mobile number
25:21
mobile need a mobile number. But normally the way we store the mobile number in our phone book with the name.
25:27
So we always dial the number or dial the call with the name. But your phone directory or your telephone directory
25:34
will convert the name into the mobile number and mobile number mobile used to dial the number. Okay. Same thing you
25:40
can do also we can create one local uh phone book uh here right and we can
25:46
write here and say if we would like to dial or we want to connect or SSS or
25:51
HTTP or uh do a ping to this IP address we don't have to now uh remember this IP
25:58
address we are going to give this IP name let's say this computer belong to viml so I I can give a name to this
26:03
computer so this is kind of database we can create now what happen. Now in the
26:10
future if you want to ping to this IP either you can use this IP or either you can use uh this particular name this
26:18
particular name. Okay. So technically we can create a uh we can create a local
26:23
database uh for this and for creating local database either a windows or either in Linux operating system you
26:30
guys might know there's a local file in Linux and Windows and the file name is called etc host.
26:38
So there's a file called host. It is available in Windows, Mac and
26:44
Linux also. This file is used to create our own local phone book for the uh for
26:50
the uh mobile uh so for the IP addresses here. Okay. But technically
26:57
in the world especially in the internet okay if you have four five 10 computers you can create your own records here. I
27:04
very quickly I just want to show you it's not maybe not so much important here but maybe if you want I'll show you how to create a local record
27:12
but if internet is big and normally um we we deal with the internet or we work
27:19
with the internet so internet if you go to one of the IP 8.8.8 rate. It might
27:25
not belongs to your company but you can use this IP maybe this IP this IP of
27:30
Google or Facebook but you can use because it is in network of network and on which we have a connect okay but if
27:38
you want to use this IP or any of the IP right very harder for us to remember the
27:44
IP even though if I ask you very simple question right every day almost everyone use google.com
27:51
and understand one thing your computer whenever Whenever you type google.com, your computer never understand what is
27:57
google.com or what is ww.google.com. Okay, they never understand how to reach
28:02
to this name or your computer guys always convert this name into the IP address internally to connect. Okay, but
28:10
if I ask this question to you, do you know the IP of Google? Do you know the IP of Instagram or Facebook? Okay, I
28:17
don't think so. Anybody over here remember this? Maybe you can find there's a different point but nobody
28:22
else has remember this. Okay. But without knowing the IP your computer is is your computer mobile is never able to
28:29
reach to those those u servers or those those computers right. So my point guys
28:35
here is we are so much dependent on the database. Okay. and somebody here
28:43
and somebody um in the world has to maintain database of all the IPs and all
28:49
the names. Okay. So if you have your own personal 510 computer you can create your own local database in the file
28:55
called host file in your Linux and Windows system. Very quick de very simple demo I just want to show you
29:01
here. But if you talk about the big world big internet or big network like
29:06
internet we have millions and millions of IPs. So it is very harder or impossible for everyone in the computer
29:14
first go and create the local database by by their by themsel to put all the
29:20
IPs and their respective names even though the most frequently frequently used website Google we don't remember
29:26
their IP also okay so that is a reason that is a reason guys uh in the internet
29:32
we had created one centralized database
29:39
and And this centralized database this centralized database um
29:46
is uh is managed by somebody and who does somebody we will discuss in a minute. Uh so this data managed by
29:53
somebody and this database guys will maintain all the IPs in the world with
29:59
their respective names name like here I given the name called for example fill for their respective
30:06
name. Okay. So one simple demo right to show you local database. So if you want
30:12
to guys create a local database for example let's say um I want to ping to this IP
30:19
and for me remaining this IP is very harder. Okay. So what can I do? I can go
30:25
to one of my local file. So this file guys located in the Linux. I'll go to
30:31
this file and in this file I can say now onwards this IP will be uh will be known
30:38
by the name called you can give any name whatever feel like so first you have to give first you to give the IP address
30:44
and then you have to give uh some name or multiple name you can also give viml I can say lw I can say a
30:52
so either you can use this IP or this name or this name or this IP it is the same thing means now if I try to ping
30:59
with the IP would be your choice choice but if you think you don't want to remember this IP you can use my name also but if you guys see here computer
31:06
never know understand the name the first computer will go to your local database convert this name to uh the respective
31:12
IP and that IP they will connect and pick so now you can use this IP or this IP or this IP any of the IP you can use
31:21
and by chance if you give more one more than one uh name to one IP so the remaining name would be known as aliasis
31:27
or nickname so for this IP are given multiple aliases or multiple nicknames.
31:34
This is one thing. Okay. And by the way, by the way, this is known as IP address
31:40
and this is the name of that computer and this IP we have given to you given uh given over here. Okay. So,
31:48
and guys this name is normally known as uh computer name or normally known as
31:54
host name. So I can say this is the one of the IP belong to somebody but I have
31:59
given my own name. You know it is something like phone book right in the phone book you can give your own name whatever name you want to give to
32:06
particular uh mobile number. So I can say this host I have given my own name.
32:12
So I can say is one of the host name of this IP. LW is also one of the host name
32:19
of this IP. So anybody can go to their own computers and they can give any of
32:25
the IP address. So if you have 5 10 10 20 computers you can give that's very simple but if you talk about the broader
32:31
way or broader world that is called internet millions of IPs we have uh giving every
32:39
IP your own name. Okay. And typing here would be very harder. First of all guys
32:45
can you connect from your computer to other computer with IP? Yes. But do you know the IP? that that is no if you
32:52
don't know the IP also we can create we can't create our local database if you if you think in this way also
32:59
okay so that is the reason there's somebody in the world and they create some centralized database and they they
33:06
create a record for all the IPs and all their respective name and they create a name or they put the name in this
33:12
database in such a way that every IP will have some unique name okay and they
33:18
also follow some convention For example, here I use any name like Vimmel or LW or A that would be your
33:27
choice. Whatever name you want to give that would be your choice. But uh somebody or some community I can say
33:35
has decided for the internet or for the networking or and they say always try to
33:41
give some name that uniquely identify the the computers. What I mean by this?
33:48
Okay. For example, there's a three computer in the internet. There's IP 1 or there's IP 2 or there's IP 3. This IP
33:56
may belongs to you. You might have given this IP name LW. This IP belongs to me.
34:02
I also give the name L. So this is my phone book. This is my local database. I
34:07
can give any name here. Okay. So if IP3 want to ping
34:13
ping to LW. So finally it will be a lot of confusing come up or there will be
34:18
very harder in the terms of network management also that finally this IP
34:24
going to PL ping to IP1 or IP IP2 belongs to my computer or belongs to your comforts. Okay. So, so technically
34:32
somebody come up with a some solution over here and they say if
34:37
you want to give some computer a name that's called host name always try to give a some unique names
34:45
that uniquely identify this computer um in in the
34:52
over the internet. Okay. And nobody will have the same name um same name whatever
34:58
somebody give to this IP and whatever somebody give to this IP okay maybe there might possibility somebody want to
35:04
give this computer name LW somebody want to give this this this computer same name LW
35:11
but even though if they give the same name but they will uniquely identify how
35:16
so you can think in this way let's say this is the one of the computer belongs to uh my company let's say my company
35:22
named Vimmel And this IP belongs to one other company and let's say this IP belongs to a
35:29
company called Google for example. So what can we do? They say because your
35:34
company name may be unique in the world. This company name may be unique in the world and nobody has the same name.
35:41
Okay. So what can you do? So all the computer that you have in your company obviously they will have a different IP
35:46
address. unique IP in the world because if you're talking about public IP you guys know if IP 1 belongs to me there's
35:52
a public IP so nobody have in the world will have a same public IP similarly if
35:58
my computer has a name LW and somebody want to use the same name they can use
36:03
but how they differentiate with the company name let's say by chance here so I can
36:10
end with and here they end with Google so we suggest this guy that if you want
36:16
anybody in The internet want to uh connect to you. Always use this naming convention. Give your computer name
36:22
whatever you feel like. You want to give LW a name to computer. You want to give a stress one this name to the computer
36:30
or you want to give www name to the computer or you want to give mail name to the computer. You can give any name
36:37
to the computer. But in the final attach your uh company name.
36:42
Okay. But they also say that we also follow one some more convention here. Okay. Because now this naming convention
36:50
becomes so much uh popular and uh and now lot of guys uh companies are there
36:56
on the internet and they want to use their computer on the internet or their server on the internet. So now we start
37:03
differentiating this these companies with their business also. So it will
37:10
also help them to doing their business well. So we ask Google Google can you
37:15
tell me what kind of business line you have. So they say I I want on the intent somebody recognized me that I am a
37:23
commercial company. So I can use squam. We say can you tell me some about your
37:29
company? I say um I think I should be recognized with India.
37:35
So that is the reason we say in the women company in the last we write in here the Google we write.com that is the
37:42
this company decide this company desired but technically I you I believe most of
37:49
guys know this technically let's say I have my own company let's say viml enterprises or viml
37:56
incorporation okay so this company can decide on the internet all of my computers IP will be
38:04
unique Obviously but on my on the internet right my all the computer will
38:10
be come under a domain called viml.in in under a under a network called viml.com
38:20
but then guys this this is called a domain domain name
38:25
okay but if if I am using this domain nobody in the world going to use this
38:31
domain okay it would be unique for me somebody can use.com is a different thing acin that is also different thing
38:38
but if I purchase this domain okay somebody somebody in the internet
38:44
managing this these guys those are known as domain registars
38:49
right registars so they are the one who maintain if somebody purchased this domain because we have to purchase this
38:55
domain okay u if somebody purchase this domain nobody can purchase so if somebody purchase google.com
39:02
uh nobody can uh purchase this doain okay so that's called uh that's called
39:08
domain register there are a lot of company in the market who work as a domain register extra where you can go
39:14
and purchase the domain monthly yearly two yearly charges they take from you.
39:19
For example, one of the example is god or one of the example is Amazon AWS
39:25
services. So if you go to Amazon and you say uh Amazon do you have any domain registry with you where I can come and
39:33
purchase some domain obviously what is available can I purchase? So say yes why
39:38
not I also nowadays work as a domain registry just pay me per per yearly of
39:44
$12 or $15 depend upon uh which kind of uh uh this this domain you want to use
39:52
do you want to use in orcom.io IO this was called guys as top level domain. So which tople domain you want to use okay
40:01
so it will be your choice whatever name you want to use. So it is not compass that you are a commercial company that
40:07
you have to use com. You can use org also but normally company will try to tell their business line that I am a
40:14
commercial company and the company belong for India from Australia from US. So accordingly they they plan or maybe
40:20
some techy company. So I use IO. Okay. So this is one of my practical
40:25
today guys. I will show you how to purchase the domain with the domain registry of the AWS. So this is one of
40:32
the practical I will uh show you today. Okay. Now this is uh one thing. Uh so
40:40
after you purchase the domain okay who purchase I purchase okay I I after
40:45
purchase the domain let's say my domain name is wiml.in.
40:50
It is just a name. what this name represent that this belongs to me. Okay. And I am
40:58
the owner of this domain. So nobody will use this domain. And now what what can I
41:05
do with this domain? So so I'll do one thing. I'll do one thing. I will go and
41:11
launch one web server. And this web server I would be launched anywhere in the world. Maybe in my local
41:17
laptop, maybe in the EC2 service. Let's say I launch this web server in EC2 instance and I attach some public IP
41:23
here. Let's say IP would be 100 and I know anybody who know this public
41:29
IP from the internet. They can come to me and connect to my web server. But I just want to give a better facility to
41:35
my customers. I don't want they will remember my IP better than they remember my company identity. And normally
41:41
nowadays company identity is represent with your domain name. Okay. So I want they will come to uh with my company
41:49
identity or plus they don't know I don't want they will remember my IP for them remembering uh the things will be very
41:55
simple for the human being if we give uh some names okay so what I'll do I'll give my
42:02
computer a name let's say I'll I'll I'll create my own database
42:07
I'll create my own database who create I create and what I have I have account
42:14
in AWS is why I have the account AWS. One of the reason is I want to purchase
42:20
the domain. This is one of the basic requirement and second requirement is right because this domain I purchased
42:27
from AWS right. So AWS has gave me a facility to create a database there.
42:34
What kind of database? Database where I can tell that one of my computer IP
42:40
running in my account or maybe somewhere. Okay. IP 100 and I want to
42:46
give this computer a host name. Okay, which host name? Maybe I want to give a
42:51
host name XYZ. Okay, so finally if somebody wanted to
42:57
come to IP0000 now it would be their choice either they type the IP address or they type XYZ.wiml.in.
43:06
But normally guys as a good practice we always try to give a computer or a host computer uh name is called host name. Uh
43:15
that name that will represent what exactly the server is doing for us and we know this server is for web server.
43:21
So typically it is normal trained in the market we always give a web server computer host name called WW. So guys
43:28
anybody who think WW has some technical meaning there's no technical meaning. It
43:34
is just a name of the computer. that is somebody has given and put in some
43:39
database it is just a host name or the computer name you can give anything but normally as a trend we use WW so I can
43:47
say this company this guy say means I I I say I can say to my entire clients
43:53
that if you want to connect to my web server just come to wwl.in in if you do so if you do so um your um
44:03
you don't have to remember my IP address automatically your name will be convert to the IP address and after your name
44:09
convert your computer will connect uh to my uh server okay now interesting thing
44:15
is important thing is here okay who will decide this name okay the owner of the
44:22
domain and who is the owner I am I'm the I'm a person here and I have the account in AWS or some other cloud or some other
44:30
provider maybe register register maybe. So we are the one who decide this name
44:36
okay but the point is guys here if you decide
44:41
your name so you have to create your own database and the database we have to write in my in my I have IP 100 this is
44:49
the name I have IP 200 the name of 200 is mailwale.in Okay. So this database we
44:55
have to create. But what is the final use of this database? Right? This database help my clients on the
45:02
internet. So it is again I'll come back to this diagram. Now this one let me again create a fresh
45:09
one. So right now for example in my laptop in my laptop if I type ww.google.com
45:19
or let me let me type www.veriml viml.in
45:24
in if I type okay and if you ask my laptop can you able to ping to this IP
45:31
or this name laptop say no I don't understand I don't understand any of uh any of this
45:40
sorry any of this name I only understand IP address so by default behavior of your laptop your mobile phone is if
45:47
somebody type any name in your command line or maybe in the browser your laptop
45:52
by default automatically send a request to their one of the server
46:01
one of the server and say you are my server and your duty is I am coming to
46:07
you to know uh the IP of this because till the time I know the IP I won't able
46:13
to connect because my laptop or any OS in the world only understand the IP address. So can you help me and provide
46:21
the IP of this guy. So the server say okay the server say uh by chance
46:27
internet is big there's lots of computer lots of computer and uh every computer
46:35
we have some public IP and every computer owner normally give their own name also okay so I don't know which uh
46:44
I don't know the IP of this guy or this guy or this computer name I can say okay
46:51
but I know one I know one thing uh this name is belongs
46:56
to a domain called webl.in Okay. Okay. So, I'll I can help you. I can
47:04
help you to to go there. Ask the owner
47:09
of this domain database guy you know this one this
47:15
database guy and ask do you have any information about this name? By chance
47:20
we they had IP. So this system this system will somehow go to internet
47:26
somewhere and try to find there's a long process for this but they try to find
47:33
uh who is the owner of uh vimmel.in in
47:38
they're trying to find. Okay, understand one thing guys. They are trying to find
47:43
the owner of this domain database here
47:51
and as soon as they reach to this particular database
47:58
they ask this database or I can say they query this database do you have any information about WW.LE.in
48:04
or I can say WW They say yes we have and they say I have information there that's
48:10
IP 100 or what are the full IP they have. Okay. So this database
48:17
this database reply yes I have the information and they reply uh to this
48:22
server and this server will reply to your laptop.
48:29
Okay. And after your laptop get the IP address. Okay. Obviously after you get the IP you can go and connect uh to
48:35
whatever IP 100 internally for you. It is something like this. So
48:41
technically in this whole process in the whole process if you talk about this
48:47
server this server is looking at your domain name whatever you want to connect
48:54
looking at your domain name and try to help you
48:59
uh to convert this this full name into the IP address and for this they don't
49:06
have a local database but they will go and find somewhere and retrieve
49:11
that information from some system. Okay. So I can say I can say this server is my
49:17
domain name server or the full name is called domain name system server DNS
49:24
DNS. Okay. So this is one of my DNS server. Okay. But this DNS server is
49:30
doing one thing for you. They say I am a DNS server from your laptop
49:36
but I don't have the information but I can help you for for for finding this information finding this information
49:43
from somewhere that easy reason guys this DNS server is known as forwarding DNS server
49:51
forward okay so this DNA server where we don't have any database actually because
49:59
technically every home right now you're sitting at your home maybe uh every home you have
50:05
your own personal DNS server but I don't think so guys none of the
50:10
guys in your DNS server have manually go and write the IP of Google IP of Facebook nobody has right okay so I can
50:18
also use one word here might not be relevant word but you can say
50:24
uh right now your server is work as a domain name system okay but it's kind
50:30
Null. Null means they don't have any database. They are helping you and
50:36
forwarding your request to somebody else and try to help. Okay. But the main
50:42
system where the forwarding and finding okay also what they running on one kind of server. Again this server is also
50:48
known as DNS server. But this is the actually this DNS server
50:55
where you actually find the record of this domain are known as master DNS or
51:00
maybe also known as primary DNS. So this is the primary DNS or I can say
51:06
the right word not primary uh better word would be a master DN. Okay. So this
51:12
also one of the computer running here running here who is
51:18
managing I am the one who has the AWS account. So in my AWS account I create
51:23
my own database and here I uh update this information.
51:29
Okay by chance this database here is not known as database here this database is known as zone.
51:36
Okay this is not a easy is a different thing you guys know everybody zone here this database is known as zone and when
51:43
you guys create this information here every information here is known as record.
51:49
Okay. So we will I log to for my account after I purchase my domain.
51:55
Okay. I create one of my zone here for this domain and in this domain I just go
52:01
and create multiple records as much as I uh want here. Okay. And this database
52:07
because is there in my account and this my account is my AWS account. Okay. So
52:15
um your local DNS server. Okay, by the way guys, this local DNS
52:20
server is normally available in your uh broadband. So anybody who has a
52:26
broadband modem, okay, that broadband modem come normally
52:31
uh with a DNS server technique. They don't have any database
52:37
but they work for us for a laptop or for a mobile phone as a real DNS but they
52:44
don't have but how they work they just forward all the request and try to find
52:49
uh actual master DNS master means master database means master zone
52:57
for this domain this doain and after they reach to this guy and there's also
53:03
processor Guys again we are not purely in the DNS classes but there's a lot of process behind the scene the way they
53:11
reach to uh this database right and uh and and take their record from there
53:18
okay and they give back to you and after they give back to you okay so this
53:24
master DNS also feel that that maybe your laptop or final
53:31
user going to come multiple time to me again again because when you guys hit to any website you keep on refreshing the
53:37
page and if you keep on refreshing the page and keep on refreshing the page uh every
53:43
time your request from the laptop always go to your DNS and DNS will send to main
53:48
DNS they will reply back so unwanted guys every refresh you keep on coming to
53:54
me it will unwanted uh you know slow down you also and it also unwanted hit
53:59
me multiple time obviously it will hit my performance So normally your master DN is whenever
54:06
they reply first time for example what they reply they reply that if if you come to me what viml wiml.in in
54:17
name. Okay. And for this domain name and inside this domain you come for this
54:22
particular host name. Okay. And so guys in this comp in the company name by the
54:27
way uh this www is known as host name. This part is known as domain name. And
54:32
the entire part sometime also known as host name but it is not technically known as FQDN
54:39
fully qualified domain name. So it's a full name of your computer fully called
54:45
for domain. So this entire name either you can say FQDN or you can say um
54:50
sometime also known as host name but the initial part is known as host name and remaining part is known as domain name.
54:57
So your DNS say you you're coming to me with this host name and I'm replying
55:02
this host name has IP. So this information I I am u I am giving
55:10
to your local server your forwarding server. Okay that normally you have in
55:16
your u modem okay normally you have in your modem or normally if you use a
55:22
hotspot also on mobile phone they also come with this kind of DNS server program. Okay. So, so, so I am the
55:30
master server. I'm asking your local server to also do
55:35
one more facility and provide you a one more facility. Uh, the facility is called cash
55:42
caching facility. So catch this information for some seconds and then
55:49
give information to you so that if you again come to me your local server again
55:54
don't again find me on the internet and uh don't again uh hit me uh for same
56:02
information and give to you. So they always next time they will give this information from their ces. Okay. And
56:10
that easy reason your local server is also known as cache DNS server or cache
56:15
only DNS server. So there's a lot of kind of DNS server available in market. Master server,
56:22
forwarding DNS server, cache only server, secondary DNS. So or I can say slave DNS. So I'm not going to do those
56:29
those different topics because we are not on the pure pure
56:35
DNS configuration topic. But this is some of the concept we might use in
56:40
today's class. Okay. So typically typically uh your laptop is always
56:48
connected with one of the DNS server. Otherwise if you're not connected uh if
56:54
you're not connected with any of the DNS server and if you try to type any of the name like Facebook or Google it never
57:00
work. Okay. Okay, if you guys very easily work, why?
57:07
Because behind the scene, my laptop is connected to one of my local DNS server. Uh that local DNS server work as a
57:13
forwarding server. They send to the main um Google database here. Why Google?
57:19
Because I connect to google.com. So Google maintain their own database for their domain name. That's called I
57:26
can say they they they have their own authority of google.com
57:34
database zone I can say and they reply from there the IP address my laptop get the IP address I laptop get the IP
57:41
address and internally my laptop connect okay but at the same time my local um
57:50
DNS server also create a cache so next time I again refresh is okay getting the
57:56
IP of this guy would be very fast I'm getting uh IP from my local copy okay
58:03
but one more thing I just want to tell you here uh here is your main system
58:08
where act who maintain actually the database of all the computers okay for example in this case uh the guy who who
58:17
own vimlin okay their database they decide uh they
58:23
decide when they uh reply to the when they reply uh to the forwarding
58:31
server and asking them to create a cache of it. So how longer the cash will be
58:37
meant. Okay. So maybe for 1 minute or 2 minute or 1 day or 2 day. So they decide how
58:44
long the cash uh will be maintained there. Okay. The desk called guys time
58:51
to live TTL time to live.
58:56
So whenever any master whenever any master
59:02
computer reply to a forwarding server and asking them to create a cache
59:07
because they also work as a cache server. Okay. So they're asking this information
59:13
wimmer.com or women.in with this IP address. This information you have to uh
59:20
store in your caches for let's say for 120 seconds means after 120 second okay you have to
59:28
forget this information so after 120 second any laptop again come to you you again come to me ask for the new
59:35
information maybe IP might change or maybe same whatever that you have that point in time I keep the information
59:41
again store for 120 second and from your local database keep on giving to your local network or local guys
59:49
at is it work like this. So technically guys the final conclusion is we don't have to actually discuss in that much
59:55
level okay in this training but uh as uh if I try to conclude
1:00:02
if I try to conclude okay in the simplest uh term from your
1:00:08
mobile phone or laptop if you want to connect to some of the
1:00:15
server let's say www.google.com google.com.
1:00:22
Okay. So from a laptop you want to connect to server B. Okay. Your laptop
1:00:27
never directly connect to this guy. They always contact to DNS server. So laptop
1:00:34
connect to DNS server and say I have a name or I have the host name or technically
1:00:42
right what is it's called I have FQDN. Can you help me to find the IP of this?
1:00:50
Now is this DNS will somehow find very high level I explain you by this
1:00:56
forwarding and all those things. Okay. But this DNS will uh somehow find the IP
1:01:01
and they give the IP of this host name and after laptop get the IP internally
1:01:08
they use the IP for the connectivity. So this is the simplest diagram you can think of and by chance guys by chance uh
1:01:16
DNS is helping to convert the IP so you convert the name into the IP this concept is called
1:01:23
lookup lookup and it's also known as resolve.
1:01:30
Okay. So um um so DNS help us to look up
1:01:37
or resolve uh the name into uh the operators and this kind of lookup is
1:01:44
also known as forward lookup means if somebody give a name and asking
1:01:52
to convert into the IP this is known as forward lookup
1:01:58
and there might be some scenario come up guys in U in the networking world I
1:02:03
don't know have you seen this kind of scen or not but there's some application they say I know the IP can you help me
1:02:09
to find the name or host name or FQDN name
1:02:14
okay normally we don't see this scenario nor very normal but there's a lot of application in the
1:02:21
market who say I know the IP for but some some reason I want to know the name for example I know the IP 8.8
1:02:27
I just wanted to know the name of this computer or host name of this computer. Okay, one of the application is mail
1:02:33
application. So anybody who in the mail the so for doing some for some kind of
1:02:39
um saving us from the some kind of attack or fishing attacks uh some mail
1:02:44
server use this concept how again is not important. Okay. But technically there's some scenario where
1:02:51
where you know the IP and you have your program you or your program will want to
1:02:56
know their name and this is called reverse
1:03:02
lookup. Okay. So in the DNS world this is a normal term forward or reverse but then
1:03:07
DNS has their own keywords for this and this
1:03:12
keyword is called type. So in the DNS if you want to convert the name into IP this is called a type and if you want to
1:03:20
convert the IP into the host name is called PTR type.
1:03:26
So like this there are lot of type available in the DNS A type PTI type NS
1:03:31
type okay MX type S SOA type so we will discuss in today's class okay this is
1:03:38
again simplest example okay so technically
1:03:43
technically u uh if you try to conclude okay it means if I say this statement
1:03:51
that all the company in the world normally have a name this called uh
1:03:58
domain name. Okay, domain name is not the right term I can say because because
1:04:03
if I say my computer has a domain name or my server has a domain name is is not
1:04:09
the right term because domain name looks something like thisl.in In
1:04:15
it is just a name like it this name represent that we have a lot of computer
1:04:20
and all the computer has a name and with this one okay for example one of the computer I
1:04:27
have maybe this is a computer having the IP uh 0.1 and this computer I have given
1:04:34
a name called uh server one but if somebody asks computer can you
1:04:39
tell me the full name I can say server onel N so I can say this IP or this computer
1:04:46
belongs to this domain. Similarly I have one more computer here
1:04:52
okay having IP 192 168 uh 0.2 and let's say this computer I have given the name
1:04:58
called mail but full name is mail.wimal.in
1:05:03
again this computer host name is mail is belong to same domain I can say the full name of this computer
1:05:09
is this one. So anybody from the outside world want to connect want to connect to
1:05:15
uh this IP they can use this name and this name will help that particular
1:05:21
client to connect to this computer. Okay. But the sambi here is uh the important si here is uh is
1:05:29
sorry the important si here is who maintain the DNS database again I'm
1:05:38
repeating guys who maintain the DNS database there is somebody centralized
1:05:45
company or centralized body in the internet answer is no
1:05:51
every company normally maintain in their own DNS database.
1:05:57
Okay. So let's say my company name is Linux world. I purchase a domain. This is my choice.
1:06:05
This one and in this domain right I from
1:06:10
this domain I will u I have given two computer a different
1:06:16
name. This is server one and me. Both the guys name I have associated with my
1:06:22
domain. Okay. And this name has this IP. This name has this IP. Where I mention I
1:06:29
maintain a database where in my personal database or I can say database is not
1:06:36
the right term in my personal zone. Okay. And how I can create my personal
1:06:42
zone? By creating my own personal DNS.
1:06:48
or because in my DNS server I'm going to create a database or my zone is the same thing or I'm going to create a record
1:06:55
for IP1 name server one for IP2 name mail
1:07:01
because this is my own personal database and this this database belongs to my own domain.
1:07:08
So I can say I am the authority authority
1:07:13
server for my domain or I can say I am the master server for on on my own DNS
1:07:21
server. I can say in this way so it means if you see facebook.com Facebook maintain their DNS Google maintain their
1:07:28
DNS uh our company domain name is called lwindia.com. So we maintain our DNS.
1:07:36
So all the domain guys you have seen till date everybody is maintaining somehow
1:07:43
somehow maybe sometime they they might not realize but somehow they are
1:07:48
maintaining their own DNS uh databases by chance it's not known as databases
1:07:54
they maintaining their own zones or I can say they maintain their own records
1:08:01
okay so that easy reason I uh I am saying DNS server Never never goes down.
1:08:09
Never goes down because everybody like you know like internet if if can you say internet goes down? No. The thousands of
1:08:16
network connect to each other. Thousands of IPs connected or ISPs connect to each other. Similarly millions and millions
1:08:23
of DNS server connect to each other. Okay. So I'm not showing the actual tree
1:08:29
how they have connected. So like a tree structure they have connected. But if you go more in deep dive in the DNS
1:08:36
one of my very advanced research topic I very work very
1:08:42
deeply there's one product available in the open source called bind so anybody who are interested in configuring the
1:08:49
DNS the by themsel so bind is a one product available open source product in the Linux using this
1:08:56
uh product you can create your own personal DNS server Okay. But here we
1:09:03
are into AWS cloud. So if you ask AWS cloud, do you have any
1:09:09
service that give me DNS as a service where I don't have to configure my DNS?
1:09:16
Because if you guys anybody work from buying product is a very big product lot of very complex also very interesting
1:09:22
also no doubt but lot of thing we have to do there to configure our own DNS
1:09:29
maybe master DNS or cache DNS or slave or lots of thing available over there
1:09:36
okay but you ask do you have any service for DNS as a service okay where I don't
1:09:43
have to configure my DNA Okay, I just go and create the record. I
1:09:49
just go and maintain the database. Otherwise, like you config web server like this, I don't want to configure my
1:09:57
u uh DNS server and all the DNS internal configuration settings, securityurities,
1:10:02
backups, everything you meant. Okay, just give me to create my database or
1:10:08
create my zone there. So it will say yes I have a service that
1:10:13
give you DNS as a service and the name of the service is called route uh 53.
1:10:22
So route 53 guys is a uh service name for the AWS where you just click once
1:10:28
and that's all um your DNS server configured for us. you don't have to
1:10:34
worry about. Okay. So, so again uh final uh conclusion and summary is u summary
1:10:42
is if you want to uh set up a DNS server.
1:10:49
Okay, this is a normally we always say or you want to set up your your database
1:10:57
or your zone and in the zone you want to uh create a records which record a
1:11:05
record ptr record ptr record sorry.
1:11:10
All right. PTR record. Record means if you have a name and you
1:11:17
want your DNS will provide a service where name can convert to IP and if you
1:11:22
have IP if somebody connect to your DNS either maintained by you or it is
1:11:28
maintained by a service called route 53. Okay. And they they come to this and say
1:11:34
I know the IP but can you help me to convert the IP into the host name? they will only convert if you create a record
1:11:41
called PPL like this. We have some more kind of uh
1:11:47
types available. So whenever guys you create a type they ask you which kind of
1:11:53
data sorry which kind of information you're putting here. Normally we put a type okay we'll we'll again guys deep
1:12:01
dive into this part. Okay, but in in the complete summary guys, if you are
1:12:07
maintaining your own DNS server either configured by you or configured by root 53, okay, you
1:12:13
need a domain. You need a domain, okay? And obviously
1:12:20
this domain should be unique in the world and this domain would be owned by you.
1:12:25
So you have to purchase. So I will guys start my today's class uh from uh this
1:12:31
topic. Okay. So if you want to create
1:12:39
um let one minute. So if you want to do this practicals
1:12:46
okay first of all you need a doain. Okay. So guys for my account I am going
1:12:53
to uh purchase one new domain for
1:13:00
for demonstration. But guys, if you purchase the domain,
1:13:05
even though you have a free tier account, but purchasing the domain is not free, they come with charge.
1:13:14
So if you want to purchase, you can purchase. Okay. Normally around $12 to $15 per year they charge you. Around if
1:13:23
you talk about Indian rupees, uh around 1,000 rupees, uh per year they charge
1:13:28
you. Okay? So if you just go for route 53
1:13:34
this service you can a DNA service and plus domain name uh name registration
1:13:39
services you can go here
1:13:45
warm and
1:13:55
purchase and lot lot of petrol guys we are going to do from this service. Okay.
1:14:01
And here in the domain there's option called registered domain.
1:14:07
Okay. Here you can go and u and purchase a domain or I can say register a domain.
1:14:15
Okay. Just click on the register domain. Here they ask you uh choose the domain
1:14:21
name. For example, I'm searching for Linux lwindia.com.
1:14:27
They come with $12 per year one.
1:14:32
So you can see this is unavailable because this domain is purchased by my
1:14:37
company lwin.com is a website name. So obviously nobody can in the world can can purchase this. But if you try to
1:14:44
search some other name like 123 maybe try to check.
1:14:50
So it is available and they they are uh selling guys per year $12 or if you want to go for other domain.net net $11.co.uk
1:14:58
$9 subio normally very much famous so $39. So depend guys which uh TLD top
1:15:05
level domain you want to associate your name with. So all almost all the names
1:15:11
uh availables over here. Okay. So you just go and click and after click and
1:15:19
purchase they ask you how many year you want. I'll just go for one year and continue.
1:15:26
So guys, even though this uh account you guys are using a free tier account
1:15:31
uh but uh they will uh uh charge you guys for domain registration. Okay. And
1:15:38
you can put your um information because when you purchase from any domain, you have to put your detail of your personal
1:15:44
or your company. I have already put here and you want nobody in the real world
1:15:49
can see your information. You can enable this privacy. All right. So there's a
1:15:56
lot of way we can go and find out the information and the owner of this domain
1:16:02
like who own lw.com. So contact number the address will come up. But if you
1:16:08
make it private nobody can from the internet can see about this domain. So
1:16:14
by by defa so you can enable it. Okay. And finally guys there's somebody come up. Okay. And just click on agree and
1:16:23
complete the order. Okay. So guys for today's demonstration this part I already did
1:16:29
already did and um one domain I already purchased today only. So I can show you
1:16:34
the further practicals. Anybody who are interested to do the practical with respect to DNS or DNS a service they can
1:16:42
go and uh purchase the doain but the domain guys you can use uh to in your
1:16:49
load balancer your your web servers and XYZ also I'll show you multiple demo how
1:16:56
to use um the your name like for example ifin so you can put one website uh in e2
1:17:04
and we can give the ww.wiml.in. So anybody in the world who can type this name ww.wiml.in or xyz.l.in they can
1:17:11
reach to your site or your other services. Okay. So the one doain I already
1:17:18
purchased guys today. So I don't need this because after you purchase it take
1:17:24
around 30 minutes to process some uh process your domain
1:17:31
behind the scen. So to save the time I already purchased so let me cancel and
1:17:37
if you see guys just today I purchased the domain and my domain will going to expire after a year
1:17:43
okay and the domain name that I purchase is called r linuxorld.com so this is domain name I purchase okay
1:17:51
and how can I purchase or from where I can purchase a domain name from any of the uh domain uh registers okay so AWS
1:18:00
is one of the domain registry you can purchase from here you can purchase from 4D and uh there's option called transfer
1:18:05
domain. You can transfer here and there. There's a different point. So I'm not going for that part here. Okay. So my
1:18:11
domain name is uh is uh purchase and uh
1:18:16
and um we are going to uh you know create a DNS uh record for this domain.
1:18:25
Okay. So what exactly we are going to do?
1:18:31
So now we have a domain name.
1:18:36
So we have a domain name that's called r linuxorld.com.
1:18:43
Okay. And my plan is guys u uh I my plan is to uh create
1:18:50
codes or I can say uh databases or I can say
1:18:55
information uh of some of the IPs for this particular domain.
1:19:00
Okay, one of my plan is I have one computer let's say IP 1 and I want uh
1:19:06
this IP uh if somebody want to reach to this IP rather than they type the IP address
1:19:12
what I want if they type viml or maybe if they type xyz
1:19:19
linuxorld.com they can reach to this IP either they ping or they open from the browser if
1:19:26
they have the website they can reach you so I would like to maintain or create
1:19:32
this information or the record. So for this you have to host your domain
1:19:38
where in the DNS server and hosting a domain in the DNS server
1:19:46
is known as zone or hosting a zone.
1:19:52
Okay, you have to host a zone in the DNS server. But who maintain DNS server? You
1:19:57
don't have to configure. we have to go for managed one that's called route uh 53.
1:20:03
Okay. Uh so that is reason if you see here on the top this called hosted zone.
1:20:11
Okay. So if you click here. So guys as you as soon as you purchase
1:20:17
the domain uh from name from the AWS they automatic host
1:20:24
this zone for you and they automatically create two
1:20:29
records for you. So what are use of this two record? Uh we will discuss
1:20:35
but right now I if I click in this domain name. So guys, this is page. This
1:20:41
page is called DNS page or zone hosted page. Okay? Or I can say this page where
1:20:49
I'm going to create a database. Okay? And if I click here, if I click
1:20:56
here, you can see I have a two records and this is the type we are talking about. This is you know we talking about
1:21:03
a type called E type or PTI type. So you don't see any type called A and P NS SOA
1:21:09
we will discuss but you don't see any type called A type. So you want to create some more record here. There's
1:21:16
option called record. Re record you can think like information or the database if you want to create here. So pretty
1:21:22
simple. So I click on the create record and say if anybody come to XY
1:21:30
rinword.com. So my this DNS server behind the scen
1:21:37
that is managed by AWS give provide them a IP called 1.2.3.4. You can give any IP
1:21:43
where you want to resolve this one. Normally obviously you have to give your IP where your service is running but you
1:21:49
can give any of the IP address. Okay. So for doing this demo what I'm doing here
1:21:55
uh to show you some interesting practicals I am going to launch one of
1:22:01
my EC2 instances. so that I can show you some other demos
1:22:08
also. Okay. So I'm guys launching one uh computer in Mumbai region.
1:22:16
Okay. You guys know how to launch. So I am going to launch one computer here
1:22:23
in the Mumbai and I'm using my AMI. So everything is preconfigured
1:22:29
and for some reason guys I'm launching let's say three instances because some of my practical I'm going to use and we
1:22:36
are going to associate some associate some uh public IP here. Okay.
1:22:44
So three instances I am launching here.
1:22:49
Let's say this is OS DNS one
1:22:54
security hub. I'm allowing all traffic. So anybody can connect to my web server if they know the IP address.
1:23:01
Right? So this part you know guys if they know the IP address but today my plan is not to connect to this web
1:23:07
server with the IP address. Uh my plan is to connect this web server with the
1:23:12
name which name this one xyz.ele.com
1:23:19
rinuxorld.com. Okay. is because I don't want anybody have to remember uh this big IP. Okay.
1:23:27
So when I launch my instance, okay, you guys know when you launch the
1:23:32
instance, this instance will have some this kind of public IP. So very hard
1:23:38
guys for the clients to remember. Even though if you notice one thing,
1:23:43
Amazon behind the scene also give some name to this IP. This name is called
1:23:49
host name or FQDN name. But in the market guys normally this kind of name is also known as DNS name. So Amazon has
1:23:56
given one DNS name also. So Amazon maintain some kind of DNS server where
1:24:03
in your VPC if you remember in the VPC I enable one option called DNS right. So when you enable option in your VPC so
1:24:12
whenever any computer who launch and that particular VPC and that particular subnet Amazon will maintain their own
1:24:20
DNS okay where they put the information in their DNS domain here is
1:24:26
amazon.awws.com aws.com but this DNS is maintained by AWS. It is
1:24:31
a this DNS is owned by uh owned by AWS.
1:24:36
So if you want to give some simple name like wiml.amazon aws.com you can't give here they will
1:24:43
give the preddered name here. But guys if you are hosting any website here uh
1:24:51
for your company obviously this name doesn't looks good to provide to your client. Even though you can provide this
1:24:56
name to the client, they can open your site thing will work no challenge. Okay. But
1:25:01
this IP is this name is again the FQDN but is very complex and doesn't represent your your uh company. So today
1:25:10
guys I would like to open this website not from this kind of name given by AWS or not from this IP uh that is uh given
1:25:18
by the AWS. I want to give my own personal naming convention here. That's
1:25:23
called DNS name or the host name or the FQDN. Okay, for this I purchased my doain and
1:25:29
m doain here I'm giving the name let me give some realistic name here www you
1:25:35
can give any name what so it means anybody
1:25:41
who come to wwinware.com
1:25:46
my DNS will resolve this IP uh this name into the IP and because you're
1:25:52
converting the name into the IP that is reason is called type A see a record
1:25:57
type called a there's a lot of different kind of types available but this type is called a type that's all okay and guys
1:26:06
you know what I told you already
1:26:11
right now here I am me this domain belongs to me and I'm configuring my own
1:26:17
DNS maybe is managed by route 53 but technically we are configuring our own DNS we are creating a real records so
1:26:23
this DNS is called master master DNS.
1:26:29
Okay, a master DNS is the one who always maintain the TTL time to live. Why?
1:26:35
Because normally nobody will directly connect to the master DNS, right?
1:26:41
Everybody is normally come from the local DNS. Local means I explain you know the uh this one. For example, if
1:26:50
you talk about my laptop, okay, and if you run the IP config command,
1:26:57
this command will tell me that uh my internet is connected
1:27:02
from some u uh router, wireless router here. And this is the IP uh my wireless
1:27:08
router or modem provided me. But if you run the if config command with hyphen all option or I can slash all option in
1:27:16
your command line of windows you will get some extra detail and what you will um get here okay that um the
1:27:27
DNS server name is this one. So for my laptop my IP is
1:27:34
is 140. Okay. But my DNA server is this one. And
1:27:41
technically if I try to see here, this is one of my IP of my home modem or the
1:27:47
broadband. So technically technically
1:27:54
okay or maybe if you connect to your hotspot most probably you will get the IP address of your hotspot. Okay. So
1:28:00
technically from my laptop if I type www.google.com
1:28:06
google.com my computer say I don't know this name
1:28:11
this name uh I need IP of google.com so my computer will send a request to this
1:28:18
IP and say you are my DNS that's all now this is your duty to give me from the
1:28:24
database they say I intend this I don't know the information about Google so they will forward the request on the
1:28:31
internet somehow there some way mechanism they will reach to the DNS of
1:28:36
the guy who of this company that maintained google.com domain and they hosted this zone and they asked in the
1:28:43
database do you have any information for this name if you have can you provide the IP this IP come to this guy your
1:28:51
local DNS or create a cache here and provide to this guy
1:28:59
okay and how can I see this information there's a way so guys in the command line in Windows
1:29:05
If you um if you just try to ping google.com
1:29:11
okay you will see guys when you connect to this name you will always your name first convert to i but who is helping to
1:29:19
convert your for you your local and technically this local DNS is not
1:29:25
the real DNS and guys this kind of DNS is known as non author DNS they are not
1:29:31
the actual authority of the google.com But the actual Google DNS that is
1:29:37
managed by Google company actually we can't go there see there update there they are known as authority or the
1:29:42
master DNS okay so they already man forward the request and cash the request and how
1:29:48
much time they cast depend how much time they ask them to cash so they always send the TTL and how can I see this so
1:29:56
there's a command guys very famous command so if you want to find the IP of some Ping is a simple
1:30:04
command you can use but there's a a specialized command for this called ns look up.
1:30:10
Okay guys DNS server is also known as DNS server is also known as name server
1:30:19
because they maintain the name for the computers. So either you can say DNS server or either you can say name server
1:30:25
is same thing. So that's what the command also says I am looking up from the DNS. Okay for for this and what you
1:30:33
see here okay this command say that if contact to your DNS server by chance
1:30:40
this DNS server is known authority they have they don't have a authority for this domain but they somehow go forward
1:30:48
and find the IP of the Google and this what the IP of the Google they found for
1:30:53
us okay so NS lookup guys command is the one uh through which you can see but
1:31:00
when this your local DNS server reach to main Google DNS and that Google DNS give
1:31:06
this IP address. So they give this information plus they also give one more information to this your local DNS or a
1:31:13
cache DNS that's called TTL. Okay. How much detail they give you? So
1:31:18
we we can see this. So this option here is called hyphen d bug.
1:31:25
Okay. So in ns guys we have option called hyphen debug. So if you use this option you will get
1:31:31
some extra detail also what information sent by uh DNS of google.com
1:31:39
for this particular name. One of the information they send is the site but some more information they will send
1:31:45
you. If you guys lots of information they send you actually. Okay. But one of the information that they send uh to you
1:31:52
is they say you ask me for this name
1:31:59
right? And what do you ask me? You ask me a type means you want to convert this name
1:32:05
into the IP address. And I answered to you that this is the IP
1:32:12
of Google.com. Plus I have s send you one more thing and that thing is called
1:32:19
TTL this 3 minute 37 seconds. Okay. And 37 second. If you again run this
1:32:25
command. Okay. 3 minute 2 minute 56 seconds. Again if you run
1:32:33
the command if you time is decreasing 31 second again run 45 second 2 minute 45
1:32:39
second. Okay if you again run 23 second time is
1:32:45
decreasing. Okay. So what I mean by this? It means
1:32:50
um it means you now guys whenever you are getting this IPs
1:32:56
you you are getting your IP information from your local DNS and local DNS updating you in my case my windows to my
1:33:04
IP 140 that uh I am a known authority. I am giving this information for my caches
1:33:09
and my in my caches this information is keep for this much more second. After this I will remove my caches. Okay. And
1:33:18
in this case I will again go back to main DNS server of Google. Whatever IP they provide me or they might be changed
1:33:25
there. I will get the latest information and again provide it to you.
1:33:32
But technically no none of the computer laptops or mobile phone directly hit to the main DNS. They have multiple
1:33:39
uh caches server behind this in uh come up. Okay. come up. So maybe my modem
1:33:47
also connect to my ISP DNS. My ISP will connect to other guys and lot of you
1:33:52
know hopes we uh might have. So again
1:33:58
this we don't have to again uh discuss uh so much in this train. Okay. But this
1:34:05
debugger is great. They give you lots of information about everything. But same thing if you
1:34:11
see here if you look up for www.rlinxorld.com rinuxorld.com
1:34:19
see this domain I purchase okay so ns lookup command guys will go
1:34:25
to the DNS of this domain name and by chance this DNS is going to managed by
1:34:31
us but I know till now in my record I don't
1:34:36
have any information for this guy because I haven't saved till yet so if I ask man locus lookup command they say
1:34:45
we don't have any information about this FQDN or this name
1:34:51
and who replied to you my local DNS my my modem here my modelm will go
1:34:57
somewhere reach to this guy reach to the again actual DNS that is
1:35:02
managed actually by us but they found nothing there but as soon as save
1:35:08
this record have saved and if you see here now in my DNS
1:35:14
okay In my DNS one record has been saved. Now anybody in the real world
1:35:20
anywhere in the world because this is a public DNS okay who look up for this name they
1:35:27
will find this IP. Okay. Right. So if you look for this name see here this IP
1:35:32
come up or maybe this IP real or live or you can put anybody else IP there's no
1:35:38
challenge you can uh put it but anybody who come connect to this name uh this
1:35:44
name will connect to this IP and this IP is actually IP of your issued instance. So anybody
1:35:51
who know the IP they can see my site but now you guys don't have to put your IP address you
1:35:58
can use your linuxorld.com
1:36:04
now onwards you can give your own personal domain name or the host name
1:36:11
here same output come up same output come up okay so it is your choice what
1:36:17
which name you would like to give Guys, normally it is a uh facility of your
1:36:24
browser. Whenever guys any website name start for WW, your browser doesn't show you. It doesn't means it doesn't means
1:36:33
you are connected without the name. Even though if you copy your name and paste in the notepad,
1:36:39
you actually see the complete name. Okay. So that is a one uh small
1:36:46
information from my side. So you can give any name guys or whatever uh you feel like. Okay. So this is one
1:36:53
information here. Okay. One more benefit guys you can um get from the DNS
1:37:01
uh here is but one more thing I just want to tell you here is if you run the debug uh debug command okay what you
1:37:07
will see. Okay, debug command. You can see
1:37:14
we query for um we query for this name.
1:37:21
Okay. And uh this IP come up and the 200 one uh is the total number of ptl. Now
1:37:29
guys, if you again keep on hitting you keep on hitting um your
1:37:34
uh name, it won't go to main DNS server like in my case is route 53
1:37:41
and you are getting this information from a local local DNS. Okay, till this time 38
1:37:52
uh second left. If you again hit. Okay. Um where it is
1:38:00
warm it
1:38:05
where the time goes wherever they would be right. Uh but you can you can yeah
1:38:11
one 57 second lap but after you zero again is reset to the time but you can change
1:38:18
the timer here. just go and edit
1:38:24
and here you can set the time. So if I set the timer 30 second your TTL will maintain in
1:38:31
in the DNS resolver technically they're talking about your cache server or sometime your web browser also maintain
1:38:37
the caches. Okay so sometime web browser also maintain the caches of your IP address.
1:38:43
uh so from the browser if you refresh they again don't go to DNS to it will improve the performance obviously of
1:38:50
converting your IP so in both the cases your cache timing
1:38:56
would be 30 seconds okay and guys there one more interesting topic in the DS
1:39:01
called routing policy we are going to discuss about these routing policy in very detail vocation latency all the
1:39:08
things my right now my plan is is to uh first give you some vocabulary
1:39:14
of the dness. Okay. One more thing I just want to tell you here is um
1:39:22
I want to tell you here is one minute
1:39:28
um that is guys if you uh you know sometime um uh
1:39:34
sometime if you take the example of um of uh uh ELB elastic load balancer.
1:39:42
Okay. So whenever uh you sorry whenever you create a load
1:39:48
balancer okay load balancer guys they always give one host name to you
1:39:57
see here they give one host name to your technical DNS and again guys this DNS name they
1:40:03
mention in the Amazon uh domain so they have the complete authority we can't go
1:40:09
and change this name there's no option available uh to change the name. And why
1:40:14
they give the name? Because because uh if you try to again look up
1:40:23
and look up this name. Okay. So,
1:40:29
so technically behind the scene your local DNS go and contact to Amazon DNS
1:40:36
server that is managed by their their own company and they say for this
1:40:43
host name we have provided this ID. Okay. And guys, normally when you create a load balancer,
1:40:50
load balancer, one of the thing that is uh sometime very challenging in the load
1:40:55
balancer is might not be sometime might not affect you but in most of the time
1:41:01
that might be challenging that next time maybe IP might change. Okay, the the IP because this this uh
1:41:09
name and what IP assigned to your load balancer is completely managed by AWS
1:41:15
and this IP is dynamic. This IP uh will change any point in time and that is one
1:41:20
of the reference guys I already explained you in the network load balancer. So guys in the ALB CLB IP might change
1:41:27
obviously your name won't change name will fix but IP might change but in the network
1:41:33
load balancer IP is fixed they uh won't change because in the network load balancer we get the IP from EIP EIP
1:41:40
means static IP okay but let's say we are using CLB or
1:41:47
maybe maybe NLB also we are interested to use the name I don't want to give my
1:41:54
IP to my customer they won't they can't remember this IP but obviously this big
1:41:59
name is also not uh not so much useful okay so technically what I'm talking
1:42:04
about technically I'm talking about if you want to give a some simpler name to
1:42:11
your uh load balancer and challenge is your IP also change
1:42:19
if IP is fixed then giving the name simple name would be very simple. What
1:42:25
can I do? I can just go here create one more record. I can and I can say here my
1:42:31
load balancer. Linux.com and what IP that fixed
1:42:36
we can write here because we know my load balance IP is not changing but in CLB or in ALB IP is not fix it will
1:42:44
change. So maybe my customer who will know my my name mylb.com uh they try to
1:42:49
connect this IP IP chains they won't able to connect to the loadbs. Okay, that is a reason. That is a reason
1:42:57
guys. If you have this kind of scenario where you want to give a some simple name to this guy
1:43:04
and you have a scenario IP might change like in CLB or ALB it will change. Okay.
1:43:11
In this scenario there's options they have provided is called aliases
1:43:18
aliases. Okay. And this aliases will give us a facility
1:43:24
in the DNS server and say if whatever name you want to give in your domain name
1:43:30
if anybody come to this name I will send your traffic to this guy. Okay. I will
1:43:36
route your traffic to the endpoint. You have to tell me where you want to send which service you want to send. So you
1:43:44
don't want to send to network load balancer or or elastic beans we'll discuss or application or classic load
1:43:49
balancer. So in my case this is my application classic load balancer which region they are running. So my I think
1:43:56
and they running in Mumbai region. What the name of your load balancer?
1:44:01
So my load balance is 169061. So it's 1 169061. This one that's all.
1:44:09
Okay. So in this case, in this case, let me share this screen.
1:44:17
In this case, this is my classic load balancer or maybe application load balancer. Okay, the IP will change maybe
1:44:24
in the future. This is the way the Amazon work behind the scene. But we don't have a concern about okay, my
1:44:31
client neither has to remember this IP, neither has to remember this big name. They will remember only my lb.
1:44:38
Linux.com. That's all. Okay. And that's all recorded. And on the fly whenever the client guys
1:44:47
hit to this name, even though if you just try to find also.
1:44:52
Okay. If anybody try to uh hit this name, let me use NS lookup to for
1:44:59
testing this name. It will again guys resolve to
1:45:05
the same IP. See here. Okay. Okay. So nobody has to remember this big name. So
1:45:11
normally guys like if you going to RDS also uh databases they also give some bigger name. So you don't want your
1:45:18
developer or your customer have to remember this bigger name. All right. And there might be possibility
1:45:24
you are using the resources of AWS like ELB is one of the resource of AWS or RDS
1:45:32
is one of the resource of AWS and you think the IP also change.
1:45:38
If this is the scenario then you have to use a concept called
1:45:43
LDSS here. But there's some more one more concept that is
1:45:50
very similar similar like aliases and that concept is called
1:45:56
CNAME. Okay, there's a very similar uh like aliases but have a different use case.
1:46:06
Okay. So this is one concept guys also in the DNS right alas is actually is not
1:46:12
actually a core concept of DNS. It is one of the facility by chance AWS
1:46:19
is giving to us through which they can very easily
1:46:24
integrate route services with the default uh with the
1:46:29
other services like RDS or like ELB here the way I
1:46:35
explained. So LSA is not actually core concept of the DNS.
1:46:40
If you go to any other DNS like that is configured by you like bind DNS product
1:46:45
or something like this. This is not the actual concept normally typically in the
1:46:50
DNS available. Okay. AWS give this concept just to easily integrate Route
1:46:55
53 with uh services the way I explained you here. Okay. But if you have a
1:47:02
requirement, if you requirement that you have some name
1:47:08
host name and the host name is very big and you think your name is very harder
1:47:15
to memorize by the clients. So you can give one more host name of that host
1:47:22
name and this time you can give us one simpler host name.
1:47:29
Okay. So it is something like this. Initially you have a host name sorry
1:47:34
you have some IP address and u maybe due to some kind of management you have given this IP address some bigger host
1:47:41
name like host name one and this host name is very bigger and it's very for us
1:47:47
is very hard to tell the customer because the customer won't able to type and remember this bigger name. So this
1:47:52
bigger name host one we can give one more name that is called some simpler or
1:47:59
very user friendly name. If you do so then this is called canonical name C
1:48:05
name. Okay. So if you use the IP and and the host name and host IP is called A or Ptr
1:48:12
and this type is called canonical name. Let me give interest example for this. I think everybody know what is
1:48:19
www.gmail.com. gmail.com and you guys know whenever any you
1:48:25
connect to gmail.com behind the scene they convert into IP but you know what
1:48:30
actually is not like this okay whenever connect to gmail.com
1:48:36
this is not the real name actually this name convert into a one bigger name
1:48:42
called meal.google.com google.com
1:48:47
and this is also not a actual name. This name is convert into google.l.google
1:48:55
mail or Google mail.google.com. It's some bigger name they have and this name
1:49:00
has actually IP address. Okay. So, Google have a lot of DNS or mail servers.
1:49:07
Okay. So, they they they want to maintain all the IP and they want every IP they want to give some unique names.
1:49:12
So they have some given some bigger name then they they this name they give one smaller name and this name also they try
1:49:19
to give a small name that look like a normal website. So multiple canonical name
1:49:26
or nickname they have created we can check this also. So if you run the nsookup command again
1:49:34
and ask can you tell me the name of uh gmail.com.
1:49:41
So um they say um wgmail.com
1:49:46
is actually a name of mail.google.com and this uh name is actually has a
1:49:53
nickname of google mail.l.google.com and this guy has this IP address
1:50:01
but technically if you connect with any of the guys finally you connect to this guy but actual name is this one
1:50:07
google.all.google.com google.com. Okay. And this name we have given one nickname called mail.google.com
1:50:14
and mail.google. We give a nickname called wwwggmail.com.
1:50:20
Okay. And this nickname is called uh uh C name canical name. Normally in the
1:50:26
typical classic DNS canical name is exactly equals to nickname
1:50:35
but nickname is not right word is actually exactly equal to aliases actually I'm talking about uh typical
1:50:43
DNS softwares but in AWS both the name has a different
1:50:48
meaning. So guy again I'm repeating with the AWS perspective a route 53
1:50:54
perspective by chance they differentiate this two term aliases is a different concept and
1:51:03
canical name is a different concept okay difference is ls we only can use
1:51:11
with the AWS internal services like like like elb or maybe RDS the
1:51:20
services that I told to you and canical name we can use with any of the name for
1:51:28
example for example let's say this is the name we have given
1:51:34
my lb.com and sorry this one winx.com
1:51:42
and we think this is a very bigger name we can give some shorter name for
1:51:48
Okay, for this I can just go and create the record. Okay, and we can say we would like to
1:51:55
change my record type. I can't go for less.
1:52:01
Why? Because ww.nx.com is not a domain of AWS.
1:52:08
His domain is either managed by us, maybe in the AWS or maybe other maybe in the good.
1:52:15
Okay. So it would be anywhere. So if you think this domain name or do computer
1:52:20
that has a bigger name would be anywhere. There's no meaning to create ls because always connect to one of the
1:52:25
service of AWS. Okay. But our name or uh service is not
1:52:31
here. So here in this case I can create a C name route to other domain name
1:52:39
right C name. And here guys if you see the value is again they're asking the IP
1:52:44
address they asking the value. So let's say this is the bigger name I want to give this guy a smaller name called a
1:52:51
and obviously you always associate with the with the domain name. Domain name we have to always give
1:52:57
or you can give other domain name also whatever you have purchased.
1:53:02
Okay. So this domain name uh we have here. Okay. And let me create. So
1:53:09
anybody who wanted to go to this guy they can also type a rin world.
1:53:14
Obviously WB is already very smaller name but maybe there might possibility you have a bigger name that is a great
1:53:21
use case when you have to use C name record type it's called canonical name.
1:53:28
Okay. So, um
1:53:35
um so eraser type of key name with the DNS.
1:53:43
One minute.
1:53:49
I think we have to give some
1:53:56
different domain. Yeah. What? Why is there one m
1:54:03
one m uh www is already created?
1:54:11
Sorry is already created.
1:54:22
Um create a code.
1:54:27
Oh guys actually I'm giving the wrong this is the a dot this one and the value would be www right obviously
1:54:34
okay this will value so anybody who
1:54:41
for this name this not this is not the real name it is a canonical name
1:54:48
okay of this guy and this guy will have the IP address
1:54:53
okay and this record we already
1:54:58
So this record has been created. So log guys company use this one. One of
1:55:04
the good example I show you is gmail.com. Okay. So if you see guys is a canical
1:55:11
name. So now it means if you use this IP or you use this name or use this name
1:55:17
finally you connect to this IP only. Okay. But let me try with this IP.
1:55:24
So if you use NS lookup
1:55:31
with this IP you will again lend it to the same IP guys sometime it takes some time
1:55:39
to connect. Okay now you can see again lend it to the other. So you ask for
1:55:45
this but this will come. Okay, this just is just alias
1:55:51
and alias is general concept. Alias is exactly close to canonical name. If you talk about the
1:55:57
any of the DNS command or DNS product in the market but uh in the AWS world alias and the
1:56:03
canonical name has a different meaning. Just keep this thing in mind otherwise in the real world of the DNS both has
1:56:10
the same meaning. That is the reason they use the word aliases. But for the AWS perspective this is
1:56:16
called canonical name or you can say the nickname. Okay. So that this is again one of the
1:56:22
type like this guys every type is doing for you. So DNS is like a database who
1:56:28
give uh some information related mostly related to the computer ips
1:56:34
related to computer IPs. Okay. So um um so we can use a record mean to
1:56:42
convert the IP name into the IP address. You can PTI record code if you want to map IP to the name. Okay. C name like
1:56:50
this text MX, SRV, SPF, lots of different kind of things you can put in
1:56:58
the DNS. I'll take some more of the example in my next discussion over here.
1:57:03
Okay. But the main thing in the DNS where I can uh see you can use DNS
1:57:11
uh DNS to work as a load balancer also.
1:57:16
Okay. The where the routing policy come in play. Okay. Very important topic
1:57:23
especially latency your application vetted. Okay. where you can use DNS um
1:57:30
for uh to work as a load balancer plus not as a load balancer to maybe more
1:57:35
powerful some of the feature they have very unique might not be as available in load balancer also and there are a lot
1:57:42
of services in the
1:57:47
AWS cloud behind the scene they use uh a routing policy of the less. So guys if
1:57:54
you remember uh we talk about cloud front okay where I talk about edge location
1:58:00
and I told you uh customer automatic guys uh able to detect the nearest edge
1:58:06
location wherever you are in the world so how they come to know the nearest edge locus okay so I'm in the for
1:58:13
example in my city how I know my nearest edge location maybe in this state or this city okay so here the DNS going to
1:58:23
help them. So maybe tomorrow class guys when I go for latency ge replicas I will talk about that part also and we can
1:58:30
also manually configure that part. Okay. And my next service like go global
1:58:35
accelator also use DNS a lot behind this. It's not visible but they use DNS
1:58:41
behind this. So guys u that's all for today. Topic is
1:58:47
not yet complete. we have talk I think half more class I need
1:58:52
in this topic uh uh this top topic to be completed fully. So tomorrow guys
1:58:58
remaining part we'll discuss tomorrow and um and um and maybe global accelator
1:59:05
also guys we can very easily uh complete tomorrow. So I guess try to explain the
1:59:10
DNS from very basics so that everybody can get some idea what
1:59:17
exactly happening behind this. But in the simple term if you want to give your uh site your server a name it's called
1:59:25
host name or DNS name or FQDN name you have to purchase first
1:59:32
domain name. If you want if you want uh that anybody can connect you publicly
1:59:41
then only you can uh purchase a domain name obviously you have to pay but if
1:59:46
you have your own private world you can create your own private DNS where you can give any domain name like
1:59:54
example.com there you don't have to purchase so maybe some of the example I will pick
1:59:59
about the private domain name but that is not accessible from the internet. It is like a public private IP address
2:00:05
console. But whatever domain name you purchase either public or private right in your
2:00:11
domain any of the record you want to create that will be your choice is a WW or mail or XYZ you want to whatever you
2:00:19
want to create you can create with whatever IP you want to associate it's called map that would be your choice.
2:00:27
So that's all guys for today we'll complete this topic uh uh tomorrow. Any questions, any query if you have you
2:00:33
guys can ask me.
2:00:43
Can I transfer my domain from go d to? answer. Yes guys, almost
2:00:48
any domain you can transfer from one registar um to other I can say DN DNS server.
2:00:59
Okay, any DNS server you can transfer here to there. But if you want to transfer the domain that it is all guys
2:01:06
uh I believe it is more about the conditions and the policy of that
2:01:12
particular uh domain rest. So DNS server you can transfer here and there but
2:01:18
domain name it or uh depend upon the policies whatever you
2:01:24
sign with the respective domain registries. Yes. So you can associate multiple IP to
2:01:30
the DNS. This is one of the practical I'm going to show you tomorrow.
2:01:39
Uh yes some uh somebody asked me does uh if you connect wfas.com or fb.com
2:01:45
we can connect to same site so does they buy multiple domain answer is yes so facebook.com Facebook.com is a different
2:01:53
domain fb.com is a different domain uh so this guy
2:01:58
this company um have buy both the domain and both the domain name
2:02:04
uh respective name full name I just call it WW they have connected to the same IP or they connected to same load path.
2:02:20
Yes. Uh AJ you are right. Writing routing policy is very important. Tomorrow guys I will invest more time in
2:02:27
the routing policy.
2:02:34
Uh can we manage our own master? That's what uh OM we are doing. So whatever I'm showing you here, you are managing your
2:02:41
own master DNS. So anybody who create your own record
2:02:46
right so if you're creating your own record, you're giving your own name. Technically it is known as you are
2:02:52
maintaining your own master DNS. Okay. Here we haven't configured the DNS
2:02:59
but we are maintaining or managing our own DNS database or a course.
2:03:14
What do you mean about lookup? Lookup aash means finding something, right? So in the DNS we are we are uh we are
2:03:23
finding some information that typically known as lookup.
2:03:36
Yes. Uh I use uh instead of alias uh we can use C name also for load denser by
2:03:42
using the alias uh give some extra facility also in the AWS. What is it
2:03:47
extra facility in the alias in the AWS? I will talk tomorrow.
2:04:05
Yes. Uh Tusar 53 has some significance in the route 53. Uh normally DNS server
2:04:11
work on port number 53. So route 53 name come from that one. The DNS by default.
2:04:22
So uh by defa walk on port number 53.
2:04:44
So,
2:04:57
one minute
2:05:04
uh 8.8.8 and Nishant is a master DNS.
2:05:10
No, I can say 8.8 is not actually master. It is a one technically if you talk about because now we know some
2:05:16
extra term. So 8.8.8 is a public DNS Google has created
2:05:23
okay but it is actually working as a forward and the cache DNS okay typically they don't maintain any
2:05:30
record okay and google.com record is also maintained by different guys actually so
2:05:37
8.8.8 is not actually a authoritative or authorized or I can say
2:05:43
master DNS for any of the domain as per as I
2:05:50
actually work like a cache or forward DNS. So whatever you guys ask 8.8.8
2:05:58
uh they will always go and find from somewhere else.
2:06:18
Uh yeah, I think uh the charge $12 for this uh is for year. If you use for one
2:06:26
minute or for one year, the charge is same, right? So, so this particular thing is
2:06:31
not pay as we go model. Okay. So, if you purchase a domain, they
2:06:36
charge you $12 or $15, whatever kind of uh TLDD you use. That's all.
2:06:57
So, [Applause]
2:07:09
One doubt uh can we add load balancer in value in the option C name? Yes. Uh yes,
2:07:15
you can add. Okay. And that is known as C name. You to use a C name to add.
2:07:28
So that's guys uh this topic is not complete u so remaining guys lot of
2:07:33
doubts will be covered tomorrow routing policy is very important concept of DNS we'll see tomorrow that's why see you
2:07:40
bye
2:07:52
somebody asked me bitling building guys bit also behind the scene using completely DNS Yes. So there's some kind
2:07:59
of program we can return random values. We provide with fixed domain name. Okay.
2:08:06
So you can give ABC ABCD ABC. Okay. And we create a a database for every
2:08:15
every URL or there's some con concept called hashing also they use. Okay. So some program they created whatever hash
2:08:21
value they come up they store in the DNS and that name they give to us. But if
2:08:26
you notice guys in the bitling the domain name is alo always fix bitly.com or something that the host name always
2:08:33
fix. That's all guys. See you tomorrow. Bye. Take care.
