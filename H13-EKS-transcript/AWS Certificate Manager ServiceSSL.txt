ript


0:20
So all right guys uh let's continue and uh discuss some more uh new services and
0:26
um plus the concept about AWS cloud right but I think as you now you
0:31
understood u uh services is there uh to manage the thing right but if you don't
0:38
know the concepts of uh particular thing it will be very harder to work on the
0:44
services right for example if you don't know what is netting what is IP
0:50
addresses what is net mask gateway or subnet all the things so it is somehow
0:56
very impossible to work in VPC okay similarly if you don't know what is
1:01
storage or what is use of block storage how to format the partition uh something like this so working on on a service
1:10
like EBS would be very harder to understand, right? So, so cloud guys are
1:17
um giving you a platform. Okay. They say everything they provide to us, okay? And
1:24
depend upon our our use cases, we just go and uh you know use those services
1:29
sometime also known as provisioning those services and we use it. But if you
1:34
don't know what is our purpose, what is the concepts, how the things connected,
1:41
how we can integrate the thing, okay, it is very harder to use any of the service
1:46
in any of the even though they try to make the thing very simple that anybody can very easily click and launch the
1:54
services on the cloud. But even though if you don't know the concept it's very hard and that easy reason guys I'm
2:00
trying my best to explain you every concept from very basics with the right
2:06
use cases the way I discussed with cryptography also. So you know in my last class I explain you the right
2:12
meaning of asymmetric key and where we normally use public key and the private key. Okay. And and so we so now we know
2:20
the concept. Now we can very quickly take the decision that hey this is the
2:26
place where we have to use asymmetric key and this is the place where we have
2:31
to use symmetric key or maybe these are these are some place where we have to use both the key together. Right? So
2:39
that's what guys um I'm I'm trying to focus here in every almost all the services. Right? So what is my plan for
2:46
today? Uh today guys we are going to you know learn uh some more new services
2:53
very interesting okay one service we are going to discuss about ACM okay it's
2:58
called certificate manager and this service actually help you to know the
3:04
right meaning of SSL and TLS hands yesterday guys I explained you high
3:11
level but this will actually explain you uh the actual meaning of SSL or TLS
3:17
handsacking and here I will introduce you what is certificate authority. So
3:23
this is one of the service we are going to discuss today. There's one more service called SSM.
3:28
Okay. So this service also we are going to discuss today and there's one more new service
3:35
recently been announced in AWS. This is called secret manager.
3:41
So this is one of the service we are going to discuss today. So multiple things almost all the services is
3:47
somehow related to security. Okay. But uh these are three independent service
3:52
for different purpose. So let me start one by one. So but this is the
3:57
agenda for uh today's class. Okay. So let me start one by one. Okay. To
4:03
explain you all these three services. Okay. uh let me create one u detail
4:12
architect or architecture of how we normally manage uh the uh manage the
4:19
services or manage the apps. So what I what I mean by this right so let me take one typical example and this example
4:26
will help you to understand where we can utilize these services okay so what I'm
4:33
doing here okay let's say we in a company and one of the team in a company
4:40
has created a app let's say this is the web app okay and you guys know whenever
4:46
you create a web app so normally in the web app there's two
4:52
main components. Okay, one component uh in the web app is called front front end
4:59
and this is the place where you put your web pages your HTML code or Java script
5:05
something like this. So whenever any client or customer from outside world want to access your
5:13
web app and because this is web app the normal way to access the web app using a protocol called HTTP or now you guys
5:19
know maybe HTTPS. So client will come to this web app using a protocol called
5:25
HTTP or if they want to use secure they can go for HTTPS. Okay. And uh this web app whatever the
5:33
homepage you have in your website this page will be written to the client. Okay. And maybe in the homepage they are
5:40
looking for asking your login and password or maybe this is a page where they give you a
5:45
form uh form uh to the client and asking some information about the client whatever
5:52
the guys app is meant for. Okay. And then client will put those information
5:58
here. Let's say they asking the name of the client. Let's say they asking the age of the client. So client feed in
6:05
this form and after the client feed they will return this entire data to this web
6:11
app. Now it is the uh it is the decision of this web app or the decision of this
6:17
team or the developer team who create this web app what they want to do with this data. Okay. For example, my client
6:25
has put name like let's say vimmel. Let's say they put the age is let's say
6:30
10. Okay. So is it the it is a duty of this app what they want to do with this
6:36
data. So they want to print this data uh or they want to maybe they want to take
6:42
some decision here. If the name is vimmel then we do this thing or maybe we asking email address and if the email is
6:50
what email they are sending we will send a mail or something like this. Okay. So
6:56
it's pure depend upon the web app they what they want to do with this data. Okay or mostly uh this is very common
7:03
thing your web app is doing. It is your choice in which language you create this web app. You create in PHP you create in
7:10
Java you create in Python. So recently guys, it was yesterday those guys who are with me in my I I
7:19
rise channel where I deliver delivering uh from very very basics to advanc uh
7:25
training on Python absolutely free. So yesterday this was a topic where I explain you how to create your own web
7:32
app using the Python web framework called flask or some something like this discussion we did yesterday also. Okay.
7:40
But not always or not everybody who over here the part of this program. So this is why I'm again explaining this concept
7:45
because this topic what we are going to discuss today SSM secret manager or ACM somehow
7:54
somehow this service is going to uh use in this particular uh particular setup.
8:00
Okay. So so this is very common thing uh common thing in the web app. Okay.
8:06
whatever data they receive because they think this data they want to use multiple time in the future. So they
8:13
always want to store the data permanent in one storage and the best way to store the data permanent in the storage
8:20
because the data or the information. So they normally use database. So now it is their choice they want to use MySQL,
8:26
SQLite, Oracle, poss.
8:32
So they store this data in your database. So finally web app retrieve this data and behind the scene web app
8:39
will go to this particular system or this server and they ask to store this
8:45
data over there and this is very common that your web app or website is running in a different computer let's say the IP
8:51
is 100 or database running in different system let's say IP 200 now it is your
8:56
choice do you want to run your database in your laptop in your data center or
9:02
maybe you want to run your database in or EC2 instances that but that is that you have to manage or you can go for RDS
9:09
that everything is managed by AWS. So RDS guys we already talk about in our classes in very detail. Okay. But the
9:16
main thing here uh that this part this concept guys you know already but here main thing that I want to emphasize here
9:24
is this point. Okay. The one thing that I want to emphasize here is whenever any
9:29
data come to your web app okay web app behind the scene let's say this is a PHP
9:36
code behind the scene go and first logging to your database server and for
9:43
logging for logging we have to provide two or three information to our web app
9:51
okay or I can say three or two or three information I have to provide my developer and developer write in their
9:56
code. So in their code they write two or three things. One they write what is the
10:02
URL of database means the you can think IP address. Second thing they have to
10:08
write in the code what is the username of the database. Third thing they have to write what is the password of the
10:16
database. Let's say the username of this database is admin. Let's say the password of this database is let's say
10:22
red hat. Okay. So, so technically what I'm talking about right whoever guys
10:28
created this database and normally the cloud admin or maybe normally a database administrator these are the one who
10:36
actually launch or provisioning a database for us and whatever they provisioning and wherever they
10:41
provisioning they provide these information and this information we have to provide to our developers and
10:47
developer write those information in the code because if the code of PHP doesn't have this information so so normally in
10:54
the code there's a function typically known as a DB connect function right so these function are the one who help us
11:00
to connect our web app this called front end to a database normally known as back end so if you don't provide this
11:07
information to your code your your front application won't able to connect and without connect how they store the data
11:14
or how they read or retrieve the data so this is very high level concept I think
11:19
almost everybody knows because somewhere we might discuss already but the main thing what I want to emphasize here
11:26
what I want to emphasize here is if you see here okay this is
11:32
just just a one database okay maybe we might have lots of databases
11:39
okay one database for team one database for team two one database for team three
11:48
okay and uh and maybe one of the database for team one only for developer
11:54
per uh development purpose perspective. One database for testing purp perspective, one database for a
12:01
production requirement. Okay. So if you try to create a hierarchy, it is
12:07
something like this that you are you have a global company MNC company and
12:13
you have multiple different units across the region or the countries. Let's say
12:19
one in India or let's say one in US let's say one in other region okay and
12:25
in India we have a different different departments okay and these department maybe have
12:33
different different team working on a different project team one team two and team three
12:39
okay and every team every team have their app they have the developer who
12:46
writing the app or maybe some other guys who constructing the app for their requirement. Okay. But but you guys know
12:54
already whenever we do something on the app rather than we put directly on the person system we provide one setup to
13:02
developer so that they can test their thing then we provide something to test
13:07
environment. So my other team like QA QA team they they they test the thing and
13:14
everything's when goes good then we put all those code or
13:20
databases data to the person something like this okay but technically what I'm trying to explain here is if you talk
13:26
about the bigger organization hierarchy it is see here is so big is a tree is so
13:32
complex complex in the terms of is very big in nature okay and If you try to see
13:38
here okay requirement to requirement okay every team every team let's say
13:46
team three here will require one separate database for development
13:51
purpose one separate database for testing purpose one database for
13:56
production purpose and because they are different database obviously the IP of the database is different username
14:03
obviously should be different and password is so critical thing obviously whatever password we have in the production side is so critical for us. I
14:10
don't want to share this same password to my my testing guys or my developers.
14:15
So their password would be obviously uh different. So technically and finally if you try to see here right how many IPs
14:23
we have to manage or how many usernames we have to manage or how many password
14:30
we have to manage and we have to manage in such a way in such a way that if if
14:36
somebody let's say some of the developer of team one or maybe some of the developer in
14:42
whatever department in a a and the team called team one and this
14:49
team is looking for the password for dev database okay and they say okay what is
14:54
the login and password for me for my database so I can use in my code so code
15:01
will go and connect okay so if you see guys there lots of information here I'm we have to manage
15:09
okay or lot of data we have to manage and maybe you can use one word here
15:15
because IP is what is IP that user is what like a variable or it is also known as parameter. So a lot of parameter we
15:22
have to manage. Okay. But we have to manage in such a way that management would be easy would be like something
15:29
like this. The way this diagram has been designed or this tree has been designed. Okay. But plus the way they manage is if
15:37
somebody looking for to provide me all the information of all the parameter for
15:42
this team we can very quickly figure out their information.
15:47
Okay. So technically what I'm trying to tell you here is okay we need a system
15:53
okay we need a system that is specialized in managing map parameter
15:59
okay because maybe I can create a database for uh de one or
16:06
my developer of team three of that department of India of this particular
16:11
company okay or maybe of this particular organization and I can hand over uh this
16:17
login a password to this guy. Okay. But because we are the cloud guys after we hand it over, we also have to track
16:23
right track for multiple reasons. Maybe these guys forget or we want to provide
16:30
same information to other team also or their team member also. So we also have to track these information or rather
16:38
than rather than we provide this information to this developer we will do
16:43
one thing we can create some you can think uh one kind of one kind of uh
16:49
database we can create okay and when I put all the information for all the teams okay and rather than
16:56
we can directly give this information your IP or you know password okay to these guys and normally is is very bad
17:03
practice. So what normally we do if if we provide a password we normally don't
17:09
memorize the password what normally we do we we store somewhere in notepad or maybe it's a sticky note on Gmail so
17:16
it's not a good practice to to to maintain the information over there so
17:21
what can I do I can ask all of my team member don't worry uh we will manage all your parameter in one of my centralized
17:30
database kind of thing in this kind of order in this kind of hier hierarchy. Okay. So wherever team you are in
17:36
whichever the hierarchy hierarchy you belongs come to me and ask for your
17:41
parameter means your information and whatever I have I will hand it over obviously you don't have to memorize
17:48
right because finally these information you have to use somewhere in your code
17:55
somewhere in your code okay so rather you memorize you write somewhere in his sticky note okay or some kind of notepad
18:01
or Gmail okay just put dagly in your code and put in a code that my IP is
18:07
this one my username is this one my password is this one rather than you put your password directly here rather than
18:12
you put your username directly here okay you can give the reference let's say you as a
18:19
developer team one you are developer team belongs to one of team one from
18:24
India so we can give the reference something like this so go to this global team or this organization go to India in
18:32
India go to department one go to team three and and let's let's go to test department and they have their own
18:40
personal information stored somewhere in somewhere in some service. So I'm giving you a reference. So all the information
18:47
whatever they have IP user password retrieve and provide to my code.
18:53
So rather than I can directly put my login and password directly in my code that's called hardcoded.
18:59
Okay. When I do so I can give the reference. So how is helpful? It is very much helpful in one more way and one
19:06
thing it is very common mistake sometime happen you are the team
19:12
you are team and you are writing the code sometime it is very good bad practice we have a practice of putting
19:19
every code in a same system like GitHub and after write writing the code some
19:24
maybe guys we might done good get push means my code will be uploaded to GitHub and accidentally we forget to remove my
19:31
password from my more. Okay. And for testing, we have to put the password here. So my password also
19:38
goes to my GitHub account and by chance that account was public. So it is my password has been exposed to everyone.
19:45
Okay. So that is something uh unintentionally this mistake happen. Okay. Or maybe you're working in a team
19:52
and in a collaborative in a collaboration, right? So one guy
19:57
know the password. I don't want to that other guy also know the password. But if you're working in a sharing kind of environment, okay, the other team can
20:04
also see the password. So lot of lot of points here I want to emphasize here. The main point
20:10
here is I don't want to keep my sensitive information in my code and one
20:17
thing guys without putting the information without putting this information my code won't work. So my code IP
20:24
username password but rather I put my information directly here that's called hardcoded. I can give the reference of
20:31
this particular database. Okay. So you can think this is a database. But if you
20:36
talk about AWS, AWS has a service and this service is specialized
20:43
for this purpose only. So AWS say uh if you want to maintain or manage your
20:49
parameters, your information, right? Not a file. If you want to manage the file, we have S3,
20:56
we have EBS, we have Glacier, we have other services also, NFS also we have. But if you just want to maintain your
21:04
parameter, your variables and the values in some kind of this kind of architecture or this kind of hierarchy
21:09
or tree, okay, we have a service, okay, where you can keep all these
21:14
information, okay, and name of the service is called SM
21:20
parameter. Okay. So, SM is the main service and parameter is the sub
21:26
service. So, this service is specialized meant to manage your uh parameter. So,
21:32
it is like a store store or maybe you can use the word called database. Database is not the
21:39
right word here but it's like a store to to manage your parameters.
21:47
Okay. And this service also guys help you to manage your if you guys know something about config file you know a
21:53
lot of services the config files config file you can also maintain the config
21:58
file because normally if you want to configure something in engineext server or database server or or maybe in web
22:05
server so we have to keep on changing our conf file depend upon uh requirement to requirement. Okay. So we can also
22:13
store our config file also and wherever you are running the server we can tell the server rather you access the conf
22:19
file from here we have some centralized store get the config file from there and
22:25
accordingly change your your setup something like this but main thing here is parameter what I'm talking about okay
22:32
so so I think you understood the use case use case is I have to provide my
22:38
login and password to my developer so they can write the uh those thing in
22:44
their code in the code and after they write in the code then only code or
22:50
front end will able to connect to my back end. Okay. Now it is your choice either you
22:56
put your information in your code hardcoded either you do so or give the reference
23:03
to the SSM parameter uh service. So that would be your choice. Okay. But if you
23:10
give the reference so it will save you a lot of way. One of the example I show you if your code by chance is exposed or
23:16
been compromised nobody can able to see your password or your further credentials. This is one benefit. Second
23:23
benefit is second benefit is okay you actually maintain a proper structure.
23:28
Now we have a centralized system where where our cloud admins or cloud
23:33
engineers or architects they can see they can manage the entire structure and
23:39
depend upon department to department team to team they can provide their respective information to those teams.
23:44
Okay. And plus somehow in some automation purpose also uh we can use okay you know some concept is called we
23:51
have some uh server running uh in a pre-pro environment and we want to uh we
23:59
want to you know uh promote these guys to production environment okay but
24:05
obviously I want I don't want to keep the same password here and same password here okay so we can write a program if
24:12
you are in the dev environment or production environment and use this password. But as soon you uh else if you
24:19
in the production environment use this password. So just very simple extra code we can very quickly uh you know uh say
24:27
here if you are in the dev environment use this password. If you're a production environment use this password because everything is manage centralized
24:33
nobody has to memorize because this dev is the different team all together. production is a very different team all
24:38
together rather than they keep their password in their code on in their desktop or in their Gmail email id okay
24:45
everything is centralized in the terms of my parameters okay so
24:51
uh so so managing some automation thing especially in the devops world would be
24:57
very similar so there's a lot of benefit lot of benefit of managing your
25:02
parameter in this way okay one import small benefit I will explain uh I don't want to put keep my
25:09
information here in my code. Okay. So, SSM parameter a service very simple to
25:14
use. Let me very quickly show you how to use this. Okay. So,
25:22
so let me show you how to use. So, guys this is one of the topic for today is called SSM
25:27
parameter. After I explain this topic then I move to this topic then I move to this topic. Both all the three topics
25:33
somehow related. Okay. So, let me log in.
25:45
So, by chance anybody who know Kubernetes, anybody who know Kubernetes, so
25:54
in the Kubernetes we have a uh component called config map. So this is something
26:00
like config map and we have a concept called uh you know environment
26:07
right uh variables where we store our involable in some other location.
26:12
Okay sometime look like secret if you know but not exactly no in our kubernetes classes we talk about we have
26:19
my square database and we store our myq login and password in some of our
26:26
environmental variable. Okay. This is something like this. Not exactly something like this. You can compare
26:31
with this point if you know Kubernetes. Okay. Uh but but yeah it is not secret
26:38
you know in the community we have one more concept called secret. Secret is something like this service. So this is a different service. I will explain you
26:43
in a minute what is secret manager. Okay. So what I'm doing here um uh let's
26:50
say let me start in this way. So guys whenever you create a databases
26:57
databases like RDS okay and whatever database you launch
27:04
okay whatever database you launch let's me launch one database this service we have already discussed okay so let me
27:10
launch let's say MySQL okay and uh let me go free so guys while
27:17
let's say you are the um RDS administrator here Okay. And you plan to
27:24
create a user glass savl. Okay. And you plan to give some password
27:29
here. I'm giving red hat xyz password here. Red hat xyz password here.
27:35
Okay. And finally I click and launch the instance. But I am a cloud guy. Why I'm
27:41
launching this RDS database? Obviously maybe most probably not for me. Okay.
27:46
Maybe one of my developer asked to have a MySQL database in the cloud so
27:53
they can connect their app to this database for testing. Okay. So now what
27:59
you have to do okay you have to provide username and the password and when I
28:04
launch they also give a URL that's called IP address. Okay. So these three
28:09
information as a cloud guy you have to provide to uh to your developer. Okay.
28:16
So you can do it. We can mail them. But sometime you know while providing your while exchanging the information let's
28:22
say this is very critical system or production system it might expose or it might break. So so after you create a
28:30
setup and provide this information to your respective developer or other teams. So this is not the best way to
28:37
provide to call them to WhatsApp or to to email that this is your login password IP. Please go and use uh use
28:45
this database by your app and login. So rather we do in this way we can create
28:51
this hierarchy and we say I know I know you are belong to this department and
28:57
this team and you are a part of developer. Okay. So I put all your information here in this hierarchy.
29:06
Okay. So I'm not I'm not giving you your login and password and other URL. Go to this particular location. go to this
29:12
particular hierarchy you will get your login and password okay that's that's all so simple right so we do they don't
29:18
we don't have to worry about sharing the information to those guys okay or I also
29:24
recommend is a good practice right for the developer okay what we recommend while writing the code also don't put
29:31
the login and password and username over here or here just give the reference of that
29:38
hierarchy okay so your code automatically fetch from there and after the fetch they can
29:43
use. Okay. So this is the way normally we have to decouple the thing means
29:49
disconnect the thing right means rather than putting the thing everything in the same location just try to decouple try
29:56
to uh you know put in different service and let's that that service will that is
30:01
specialized in managing those things. So let's they they maintain our our our thing. Okay. So SSM parameter is service
30:08
that is specialized in managing the parameter in this kind of global structure or this kind of hierarchy
30:15
structure tree structure. So let's them let's they manage the things and this service they we we had we have here SM
30:22
parameter to to see all the great use case in the market and that's every industry need that we have very complex
30:28
architecture in the company we want somebody who manage our information and
30:34
it is only not only for IP username password you can put any information you can put your version which version using
30:39
you can put your team manager name so any information whatever you want to maintain in your hierarchy you can
30:46
maintain there. Okay. So this what so right now I'm not launching database. Let me do one thing.
30:53
So let me open. Okay. So there's one service. Let me start from here directly. So there's one
30:59
service called SS SM. Okay. And this is called simple
31:06
system manager. SSM. Okay. But here there's lot of services
31:13
SSM. One of the service I'm looking for parameter or maybe you can direct yourself for
31:18
parameter okay again same name come up because is it a big service you know like EC2 is a big service inside EC2 we
31:26
have a a EIP elb right so like this is a big service under this there's a lot of
31:32
small small services we have okay so let me click this system manager okay so you lend it to
31:40
this page okay maybe some more service we will discuss in the future. Okay,
31:46
there's lots of very powerful, very interesting services, very much customized for DevOps kind of
31:52
environment. Very powerful service sme. Okay, I think it's simple system manager
31:58
full for I believe. Okay, but here I'm looking for a service called
32:04
service called parameter. So you can see somewhere where it is. Yeah, parameter
32:10
store. So in the left uh in application management there's a service called
32:15
parameter store. Okay let me click this. Okay so here they say if you want to
32:23
store any data maybe secret like a password or maybe
32:29
your configuration file right. So anything you want to store here maybe
32:34
your password database string some configuration data license code whatever you have you can put in uh in this
32:42
service I will manage for you okay that's what this is saying so let me go
32:48
and create and uh let this might be some steps so I'm creating your document
32:58
so one minute this is the A WS
33:06
I think. Okay. One more please.
33:15
So, so let me start from here.
33:22
So, let me create a parameter. Okay. And guys, here you can give the
33:27
name of the parameter. Okay. But or you can see here they also use the word called
33:33
path. So maybe I can give the name called database password.
33:40
Okay. So you can give uh the name also like this. But it is always uh good
33:45
practice to provide uh full path. Okay. Uh path means it is purely based
33:53
upon how your company uh and organization been structured. So maybe I can write uh SLI India SL
34:01
department one something like this. So just go and create a proper path that makes sense in the terms of management.
34:08
Okay. So that's what I'm giving here. Sorry. So I'm giving the path like say
34:14
SL India
34:19
then department one then team one
34:25
something like this. So all the information of team one I am going we are going to store it. So you can give
34:30
any name any anything but this is a good way to to provide the detail. So very
34:37
simple right? So in that future if team one want to get their information I ask
34:42
which department you belongs to they said department one then I ask which country it belongs to they say India. So
34:49
I will provide this URL not URL I will provide this path and I'll say this is
34:55
the location this is the location if you see this graph. So this is the location where we are keeping information. So all
35:01
the information whatever we have in this hierarchy I will provide to you or all the parameter I have in this hierarchy I
35:07
will provide to you. So something like this. Okay. Obviously guys is always good practice to give the description is
35:14
normally we don't provide any description but it's good practice because if you have a huge
35:21
information or huge instances or huge VPCs so we always put the description
35:26
why we are creating this right okay now there's a two tiers here standard or
35:33
advanc it by chance if you use standard it is free okay I think for some time
35:38
maybe but it's free for some time. Okay. And adv once uh it is not free. They
35:45
will charge. But only difference is okay. Here you can store the value up to 4 KB. Here you can store the value of
35:52
the parameter up to 8 KB. And some more extra benefit they have. Okay. So
35:58
there's the difference but I'm going for standard. Okay. And now here they're talking about what value you want to
36:04
store. So this is the data type they're talking about. So you can think this is
36:10
the variable okay your entire variable name is in department one t1 it is one variable or
36:16
I can say one parameter or inside this parameter I'm going to store a data in a
36:21
string so my data type is text means string okay so so what I'm going to store and
36:29
just one more thing I'm not going to store information team one right in team one what information you want to store
36:35
okay so my plan is to store the information of database URL.
36:41
So here you can give a obviously a complete variable name. So I said this
36:46
is my DB UR. So this information of team I want to store. Okay. So DB URL is
36:53
actually a final variable but this variable is maintained inside this particular hierarchy. Okay. And it would
36:59
be anything guys. It's just a variable name. Okay. So name of my database URL is so after my
37:07
after my guys my team launch a database instance I'm talking about the cloud
37:12
guys. So after they launch the database so whatever the URL of the database come
37:18
up because they know what URL come up that URL they will post you.
37:23
So let's say just randomly I'm putting here database.lanxorld.com/3306 Linux world.com/3306.
37:28
It is normally the port number for your for your uh database of but you see here
37:35
guys maximum length is 4096 because we are using standard tier. Okay. Although
37:41
if you have bigger information to store here you have to go to advanc. Okay. So this value we have stored and
37:48
that's all that's the only thing you have to do. Okay. Only thing you have to do
37:56
and let me save this. So finally in my store
38:02
in my store this is called parameter store. Okay we have stored one
38:07
information. Okay now what we have to do right we will tell my team
38:14
this team and say that you need IP address. I'm not giving you directly. I
38:21
mean giving you this particular URL or this particular location of SSM.
38:27
So wherever you want to use you want to use in your code. Okay. So go there. You
38:34
don't know the IP address and you don't require to know the IP address. Just give the reference of this parameter or
38:39
give the reference of this parameter path. Which path? This path.
38:46
give the reference and whatever value you have in this automatically populated
38:51
okay and it's also good thing guys maybe in some future IP address change by some some region so my cloud guys will go and
38:58
update over here and they will update the the IP and port number change or maybe they can automate
39:04
uh somehow and good thing is because guys here they also maintain the version so next time if you edit they create one
39:11
more version and you guys know the meaning of the version right so if you see the history they have version one or
39:18
maybe in the future by chance this is a database URL and uh we might using some kind of
39:25
database after register IP might change so my SSM manager guys here they come
39:32
and they say now this time my now is been changed to some other IP and updated
39:38
okay so guys in this case this everything is automated see here my developer write the code now in the code
39:44
they don't have to update the IP address because it very good practice. It is not good practice actually to keep on
39:51
changing your code. Just create a code in such a way that it is very much dynamic or because we are referencing
39:57
the same path. If that path change some IP address and some some other information they will get that new
40:04
information from this URL. So now it has been updated here. So if you see here now this new will come up
40:11
and now see here version two. So they also guys mention you guys know
40:16
the use of version. V version will control the version. We can roll back. We can see what we had in the history.
40:22
Now initially we had this IP address. Now IP change or something like this at what time we modify. So entire
40:30
thing we imagine guys if you're smaller environment it doesn't looks so much
40:36
useful but I'm talking about the way I also started the bigger organization they have a lots of information to share
40:43
with multiple different team okay so that makes a lot of sense okay
40:49
but how to share I will explain you okay but so this is the one thing so let me add
40:55
one more one more information here for the same thing. So it is good practice
41:00
to provide a same kind of path. So I'm going to create one more parameter
41:05
and this parameter let's say I want to store DB password okay
41:10
password. So let me store again my password in a string. Okay. And let me give my string let's say my password is
41:17
right here. So my database guy had create the password and what password they store uh they store this
41:23
information over here password. Okay. But understand one thing IP might not be
41:30
so much critical by some somehow my IP has been exposed it it might be okay
41:38
but I don't want my password to be exposed okay so what I'm trying to tell you guys here is by default by default
41:46
your uh your parameter service parameter service they store everything in a plain
41:53
text plain text okay So by chance because you
41:58
guys know the service right by chance anybody who have AM role as sub account
42:05
and they come to this parameter store they can see my password
42:11
okay normally we don't allow anybody can come here because this service and uh and you guys know about IM
42:18
IM policies okay we only allow limited guys who can see here come here but
42:23
maybe by chance we don't know some How we miss the writing the rule and the
42:29
policies this called arbback they can come here. So all the sensitive
42:35
information it is highly recommend to to encrypt and guys again here the role of
42:40
KMS coming to it. Okay. So we can ask KMS to encrypt the information and
42:46
understand one thing here we don't require to go for asymmetric key symmetric key is okay for us because
42:51
this R information same key will encrypt same key will decrypt. So this information between us only right. So
42:57
there's like lot of thousand guys going to use this. Okay. And we don't have to share our symmetric key to somewhere
43:03
else. So here we don't require to go for asymmetric key. Okay. I just want to
43:09
encrypt this information. So I can go to KMS and say KMS do you have a key that
43:16
will encrypt my data? Okay. So they say yes in your current account. This is my
43:22
current account. Okay. Do you want to use a default key that AWS provide or
43:28
you want to manage your use your own customer key? So guys in my last classes we already created a customer our own
43:35
symmetric key. So we can go here and access and you know this is the key I think in last class we had created.
43:42
Okay. So from my key and you guys see here as soon as I use my key automatic my value being hidden.
43:49
Okay. So for some sensitive information okay we can first of all nobody can go
43:55
go and see this information but by chance while exchanging while reading
44:00
while somebody by chance come they might get some extra IM or power so I don't
44:06
want to take any chance okay so they can add so there's three different types
44:12
they support only one value or you have multiple value to share or you want to share uh sensitive information so here
44:19
The role again the role of KMS if you see guys here is a very different service but KMS is so tightly integrated
44:24
with other services. So KMS is integrated with EBS is integrated with lambda it is integrated with other
44:30
services. We have seen multiple practical of KMS. Okay. Here also KMS is useful
44:37
created. So now two variable I have created DB URL and
44:42
DB parks. And now it's all is purely based upon your management. By chance
44:48
both the variable I put in this particular URL. So you'll see in a minute what is the benefit or you will
44:53
get to manage in this way. Okay. But anybody who by chance click in this URL
44:59
they won't able to see it. By chance there's a way you can click and show it. And one thing guys behind the scene when
45:05
you click okay it look like very simple just click and data come up. behind the
45:11
scene this click go to KMS retrieve your uh symmetric key
45:20
ask the symmetric key to decrypt and after decrypt only it will visible so it's so fast but it is this kind of
45:25
operation is happening behind the scene so it means if you log in from some
45:30
other account okay maybe by chance by chance by accidentally somebody has a
45:38
power to read your parameter So okay and they come here but when they
45:43
click but they don't have power on KMS because KMS is very secure obviously we
45:48
we always look 100 time what power to and to whom we are giving. So if
45:54
somebody click here they won't able to decrypt. So if you fail and they say you don't have a power of KMS to retrieve
46:00
the key from there. Okay. So somehow this way everything is
46:05
internally connected. So two information guys I have provided here. Let me create
46:11
one more information here. Okay. And this information guys I'm creating for a different team. We know
46:17
this team but this uh you can put here. Let's say this is the for department one
46:23
and this is for team two and this is the password of team two. You can give any variable name. Okay. And again I'm
46:30
putting this information in secure way. And let's say their password is redhead team. This is the password of this
46:36
table. Okay. So one more information I store here. Now you guys understand
46:44
what is the benefit to store the information in this way. Okay. So one of
46:49
the benefit is to so sorry to store the information in this way is uh when any
46:56
team come we'll ask them which team you belongs to. Okay. So let's say team one
47:04
team come team team one they say I'm team one belong to department one and India. So we ask them what parameter you
47:11
want to retrieve. So they say I want to know just URL. So I just only give this parameter name. So only they get this
47:17
information. But let's say I want to know all of my all of my parameters.
47:25
Okay. So maybe rather I give DB password different DB URL different or you might have more rather we do in this way we
47:32
can give this entire path till here. So we provide this part till here or
47:38
this path till here. Okay. So all the variables or parameter under this path
47:45
will be automatically accessed by these guys. Okay. So this way this is the way we
47:50
actually this is the reason why we are managing the path in this. But let's say there might possibility my department
47:56
one guy say I want to see all the variable all the values of all of my team. So we can give the give the part
48:02
till here. So we can give the path till here. So automatically all the team one team two
48:09
and all the parameter values will be accessed by uh that particular path. So
48:14
it is your choice how you're managing your hierarchy that will purely depend upon you. Okay. So let me guys show you
48:22
this demo. One way we can show is to writing the code writing the code like this. But
48:29
obviously guys uh there's no meaning to write a code here because not everybody know of database connectivity code to
48:35
make you comfortable whatever we have done is working properly or not. So uh technically you guys are somehow
48:42
comfortable on command line. So I'm going to command line
48:47
command line and here you guys know SSM AWS command. So in AWS we have a command
48:55
called SSM. Okay. And we command we have and this
49:01
command say can you give me a sub command and you guys know SSM is a big service under this they have multiple
49:07
options. So there's one option called get parameter
49:12
means they're asking you uh to get the parameter okay and again this command say they say
49:20
please tell me the name of the parameter which parameter you want to get
49:25
okay so by chance I know the name name means the path so let's say I want to get the value of this one
49:34
okay and every parame obviously is a unique I said this is the value uh name we have can you please provide me the
49:40
value of this one. So they go there and you can see here in this variable we have stored the value
49:47
this one. So this value come up and they also update this is the latest version value we have.
49:53
Okay and this is the text data. So this way we can quickly check by I can get
49:58
guys because I have in the command line I have login already with the root account. O have a power but obviously
50:06
nobody can directly get this because you have created a role user with limited power. Okay. Similarly if you want to
50:13
get the value of DB pass this one.
50:18
Enter. Now because this is normal text data but it is secure. So
50:25
you can see your data is come in encrypted way. Okay. So nobody can see this data till
50:33
the time they have their uh symmetric key. Okay. So if you have your symmetric
50:39
key in the KMS you can decrypt by I am a root account here. So I have all the
50:44
power to get my key. But if I am logging with some other user in AWS and I don't have power to to go to KMS. So I will
50:52
never able to decrypt this data. So data will be always so much secure.
50:58
So what I can do I can tell my team one that I'm creating one account for you
51:03
this called team one user account and this account we give some power in IM that you can go to my KMS store or my
51:10
KMS to only retrieve this key. So you can use that key to decrypt this
51:18
something like this. Okay so this way we can manage the security other things. So by a root account so I can decrypt this.
51:24
By chance in this command we have a option to decrypt. So this option called with decryption.
51:33
Okay. So this option guys behind this automatically go to KMS get the key you
51:39
decrypt the data and provide your text data. I can able to run because I am the
51:44
root account. I have the power to go to KMS. But now guys you might understand the power of IM.
51:52
Okay, just giving the wrong power to some other user in the AM service every
51:57
security will be compromised. Okay, so giving a proper user a proper
52:03
power in IM which service they can use in which service what particular component they can use. Okay. So it is
52:10
so sens sensitive that is the reason guys if you remember in my AM class I explain you a little bit more depth to
52:17
creating a policies with JSON file also. Okay. So having that kind of knowledge
52:23
it's called granual knowledge it help you to create a secure environment.
52:29
Okay. So guys this is the uh one example we have. Okay. But but they might
52:35
possibility. Okay. this team say I want to know all of my values.
52:42
Okay. So if I write till here till here what happened let's say okay
52:49
so nothing happened let me even let me run in this way nothing come up let's
52:55
say this is inval parameter so by by guys names command or I can say get parameter option only have a capability
53:04
to retrieve the value of your final parameter but if you have a requirement you want to retrieve all the value in
53:11
this hierarchy Okay, if you have this kind of requirement then we have a different
53:16
keyword for this and this is called get parameter by
53:22
path and a path here is this one
53:28
this one. Okay. So I can tell my team one that this is the path you have and
53:34
all value you want to retrieve whatever you have you can go here and retrieve and I see here in this path this is one
53:41
variable value come up this other variable value again come up and by this
53:46
is decryption encrypted we can decrypt this guy okay so this also way
53:52
uh we can we can get the particular value okay so this is one more example
53:59
we Or there might be possibility my department one say I want to retrieve
54:04
all the value under my department okay so for team one team two all the value I
54:10
want to retrieve okay so again it won't work okay because if you want to
54:17
retrieve anything uh inside this team one team two team three this called
54:22
recursive okay so we have to provide option called hyper recursive
54:27
to do it Okay. So in inside this whatever the path you have everything
54:33
will come. This will also come up. Team will also come up. Team two also come up. So they can see everything. Obviously this will require power of AM.
54:40
Okay. So otherwise they won't able to get it but I can get it because I'm a root account. Okay. So this also you can
54:48
do here. Okay. But obviously guys there's no SS binning to see the data
54:55
from a command line. Okay. We are we are seeing here just for testing or how the thing work. Okay. But technically
55:03
finally this information what we are maintaining in the centralized parameter store it is finally used by your
55:10
developer in your code. Okay. And there the guys the use of SDK
55:18
come in play. Software development kit come in play. So let's say you are writing a code in
55:24
Python language and Python language say I need this value of DB URL username and
55:31
password. We say that you can get this value from this service. So Python say
55:36
how can I connect to the service? I'm Python and with different system thing this is service of AWS how can we
55:44
connect or Java guys say how can we connect okay so we'll tell this guy that
55:50
AWS has provided a software development kit for AWS
55:55
that they provide you a way that is called library okay library and using this library they
56:04
provide you some functions or some method using this method you can connect to this service from your code and
56:10
retrieve the values. Okay. So Python if you guys talk of Python so in the Python we have a
56:15
library called B23. Okay. So B23 guys is a library is a
56:20
software for the Python using this software library. Okay. Python has a capability to maybe guys Python can
56:28
running in your local laptop. So let's say this is my Windows. So I can run Python here also.
56:34
And here I can use boto3 library. Anybody who know Python. So this is the
56:43
library we can import. It's not fail. And in this library we have a functionality available. So from my
56:48
local laptop I can connect to AWS, EC2, VPC, SSM parameter and whatever they
56:54
want to do you can do it. So my code is running locally or my code running in my different server but information I can
57:00
fetch from SSM and by having this information my code will get IP address
57:05
username password and based on this information they will connect to database running in RDS or maybe
57:11
somewhere else. Okay. So SSI is not only for RDS or something else any information you want to store that you
57:17
want to use in other way also other products also you can use. Okay. And
57:23
guys, this is one of the important topic of my developer track. So I'm not studying this topic today. How to use
57:30
SDK uh software development kit and how to use moto 3. So I'll take a separate
57:35
lecture on this and is a pure one of the very important topic of AWS developer
57:40
where I explain you how to write a code in Python and that code has a capability to use any of the service of the AWS
57:48
cloud from anywhere in the world. You don't have to write your or run your code only in AWS. You can run your code
57:54
maybe in GCP cloud maybe on laptop but you can use any of the AWS service from
57:59
there. Okay. So, so I'm not taking this topic for this you require to know what
58:06
is protocol. But I think almost main concept of
58:11
parameter store I explain to you. Okay. One small thing I just want to tell you
58:18
here is if you click here, if you click here and uh there's no as such option of
58:27
policies. Okay, what I mean by this? So let me go to parameter store. Let me create a new
58:34
parameter. Okay, and if you see here I we don't have policy available in standard.
58:43
Okay. But if we go to advance, we have parameter policy available in advance.
58:49
What I mean by this? Let me click here. Okay. And uh let me create a variable
58:55
again. Something like this for team three. For example, let's say this is my
59:02
password. Okay. This is my password. So one uh sorry value I want to store.
59:10
Let's say value would be let's say password. Okay. And guys see here we have parameter policies available. Okay.
59:18
And we can add the policies. Okay. Policy means when my uh my
59:25
variable expire or something like this or if expire please notify me something
59:31
like this. Okay. So technically if let me create. Okay. This is advanced
59:38
tier. So in this tier you can see one more extra tab come up. It's called policy. It's not there in the standard.
59:45
Okay. And here I can create a policy for my parameter. So if I click in edit.
59:51
Okay. What can you create? You can create your expense policy absolute time later. Technically in the simple term it
59:57
is always good practice guys. You know if you're keeping some information always create a parameter means uh
1:00:04
policies means for example if you want to store a password just specify your
1:00:10
password should be at least eight uh character in length or let's say you can
1:00:15
specify this value uh is there for 20 days after 20 days your password expire
1:00:21
or after 20 days we are forcing you to rechange your password if you don't change we will notify you with cloudatch
1:00:30
So a lot of this kind of automation you can do here. I'm not showing you okay because again this topic is again not a
1:00:36
part of our program okay is normally come in the security topic but but I just want to update you
1:00:43
that this also one very important topic but but you can do these things also to
1:00:50
properly automate the thing. Okay. So this is only available in your
1:00:56
advanced services means advanced tier. Okay. So otherwise almost everything is
1:01:01
same between advanced and standard. Okay. So this uh service is called
1:01:06
system manager. Okay. But in this service guys we have some issue.
1:01:13
Issue is something like this. Okay. Uh in this service
1:01:18
okay let's say we have a database password. H okay and u
1:01:26
in the d password let's say I'm storing the password at hat
1:01:32
okay this this part is very critical is storing the data by password because database is the most critical thing okay
1:01:40
so parameter service is not forcing you okay to store your information in
1:01:47
encrypted only by chance accidentally there might possibility You might store some information in
1:01:55
clear text so anybody can see the information if they have the power of IIA. Okay, this is one thing. Okay,
1:02:02
second thing is okay whenever you guys you store any sensitive information
1:02:08
sensitive information uh we need somebody who keep on
1:02:15
asking us to rotate your information.
1:02:20
Okay. Means means if you're using the red password for 10 days, change this.
1:02:28
If you don't change, I expire here. By chance advance, they are notifying you. They're notifying you
1:02:37
here for for something parameter expire. So they only uh give you access way how
1:02:47
long this value will be available. Okay, that's all or some extra things
1:02:53
but there are a lot of things guys we need like rotation or some more thing we need here. Okay. And there's nobody here
1:03:00
to creating a audit who ex when X is and something like
1:03:05
this. Okay. So technically what I'm talking about if you have a information very secure
1:03:12
I want some extra control extra management on these uh feature because
1:03:19
guys understand one thing it's not about keeping the information right okay if this information is very sensitive very
1:03:24
critical I want to control also to have proper audit also we can see who access
1:03:31
when x is okay we are forcing to change the password if guys you know if you use any banking account so normally Banks
1:03:37
has a policy that every 30 days or after this much time you have to change the
1:03:42
password otherwise you won't able to login. These are these are known as policies on your parameters.
1:03:48
Okay. So so for especially for u especially for secret information we
1:03:57
need some extra control. Okay guys here the role of new service
1:04:02
recently been launched by AWS called secret manager come in play. So seeker measure is one more new
1:04:08
service. It look work like parameter service only
1:04:14
but the only difference is parameter is service that is used normally to store a normal parameter like variables and
1:04:20
values like database URL and username. Okay. But this service is only maintained or here to to manage your
1:04:28
secret information. And whatever you store here by default in this parameter
1:04:34
you you have to choose you don't encrypt or not. But here whatever store everything is encrypted.
1:04:41
Okay. Here we can give some extra policies setup here. We can audit the things. The
1:04:48
auditing is again very important. Okay. Otherwise everything is same. So what can normally we do? Normally we do when
1:04:55
my uh developer want some information. Okay. So DB URL means the IP address.
1:05:03
This information or my username information like username for example.
1:05:09
So these two information we can store in our parameter service. This is called
1:05:15
SSN parameter. But password service this is very critical. So we can store this
1:05:20
information in a service called secret manager. Okay. So technically we can store this
1:05:26
password directly in my code also. We can store password in my SM parameter also. But I'm I'm talking about it
1:05:33
always good practice. Okay. To always look for that service that I specialized
1:05:38
in that form in password. I want some strong authentic strong security. I want
1:05:44
password policies. I want to audit right. So more facilities I want right
1:05:51
so that's what that's what my recommend is so we can go for secret manager service. So secret manager is again one
1:05:56
more service look pretty much like this service only but this is the SSM password store and we have one more
1:06:03
service called uh secret manager this one secret manager. Okay so
1:06:09
it help you to rotate to manage and throughout the life cycle if frame
1:06:15
is the entire thing that you need for your sensitive thing they manage for
1:06:22
you. Okay, secret manager. So let me show you this demo. So it's going to
1:06:30
manage, retrieve your data, password, API keys. Okay, all the things you can and very interesting thing is they have
1:06:37
a very tight integration with your RDS, your RDS or any database there they have
1:06:44
their own login and password. So they have very tightly integrated to those
1:06:49
services. So if you create a secret they ask you which database pass for you on to store okay so they have so in
1:06:57
normally in SSM parameter they don't have that much options they are very generic generic means any kind of
1:07:03
information you can store but here they are very tightly integrated with your other services that require to store
1:07:10
their service rather than you hardcore in the application you can put your thing in your secret manager that's what
1:07:16
I'm talking about this service is free for 30 days but otherwise that much they charge you. Okay. So, let me click here.
1:07:25
Okay. Now, here they're talking about you want to store a password for RDS.
1:07:31
Okay. You want to store a password for document DB, something like MongoDB, uh rediff cluster. So, there's a lot of
1:07:37
database we have for other databases or any kind of generic information you can
1:07:43
put here. Okay. So even though guys if you click on RDS okay here they ask you in the last which
1:07:51
RDS database you want to store. So right now in my RDS I don't have any database but if you have 10 database you can
1:07:56
select okay so you can select here so whatever password of this RDS of this database I
1:08:04
want to keep here. So they're very tightly indicate you know tightly means they they know about each other which
1:08:11
database password for we are storing. Okay. But if you generate information, you can click here and store. Even
1:08:17
though if you notice here, if you click RDS, they know in the RDS they require us password to store. So they give this
1:08:23
option. But if you click on other, they say now whatever want to store, you can store. For example, I want to store my
1:08:31
passport information or let's say this is my passport number. Maybe this might be very critical. I can store here.
1:08:38
Okay. And guys here there's no option to decide you want to encrypt or not. By
1:08:44
default you have to use encryption key because this is secret service. Okay.
1:08:50
Now it is your choice which encryption key you want to use either by default by Amazon or your encryption key. So that
1:08:56
would be your choice but everything would be encrypted here. Okay. But if
1:09:01
you can see the print text also your variable and the values. If you want to edit directly you can edit from here
1:09:07
also. Okay. So that will be your choice. But finally it's so simple to use. Click
1:09:12
next. Okay. Here also guys you can see create the hierarchy. So I can say this is my
1:09:18
India for department two for team one
1:09:25
and for database password. So you can give again same kind of hierarchy logic is same. Okay.
1:09:32
And uh uh this something like I am something and here guys you can plan for
1:09:38
rot. So here you can hardcode it. Okay, that I want my password or value of this
1:09:47
variable to be rotated means I am enforcing my user that they have to
1:09:52
change this password by default disable but we have options to enable
1:09:58
and we can set the time for example let's say 30 days 90 days or some custom days okay so after 30 days okay we have
1:10:08
to force the user they have to rotate means They have to change your values
1:10:15
because it's good practice right because every day you use the same password for some critical thing is not good something sometime maybe somehow it
1:10:22
compromise okay and how to notify here then you can use the help of a lambda
1:10:27
function okay so we can create lambda function here I have some lambda but you have to
1:10:33
write lambda function that that will connect to your cloud some other service
1:10:39
like email services or SMS services and they will mail or SMS to your that that
1:10:45
particular user to notify that your your password is going to expire is go and
1:10:50
change something like this. So those kind of facility is not available in
1:10:55
your parameter service but here we can custom because they have some for lambda function. So in the lambda function
1:11:02
whatever you want to do you connect with IoT devices your your your alarm start
1:11:07
budging your light starts LED starts whatever you want to do further you can do it okay so let me disable this thing
1:11:15
click next so this is a final summary and good thing is guys
1:11:21
you know finally my password is storing
1:11:26
okay in my service called security manager But who want to use this password? My
1:11:33
developers or my let's say my developer has written the code in Java or Python.
1:11:39
Okay. So they write some code and this code has a capability go to security manager pull uh retrieve or get my
1:11:47
password and update here. So typically they also provide a code sample code. So
1:11:55
these are the code they supported. So if you are under Python 3, click here and provide this code to your uh to your
1:12:03
developers. So code is pretty clear. They're using boto3. We are retrieving the password from this URL in Mumbai
1:12:10
region and there's some you know boto3 code and we retrieve it after retrieve
1:12:17
we can pass the value. Okay. Those who know Python they might know a little bit understand a little bit this code but
1:12:23
obviously for this you require SDK knowledge of Python. So in my upcoming class I will
1:12:29
talk about how to use boto3 okay in my as developer track especially. So that's
1:12:36
the code. So you can share this code to client they given you pre-created code and you can actually use that. Okay. So
1:12:42
it's a good thing otherwise developer has to create this code from the scratch and finally I will create.
1:12:49
Okay. So your now this particular variable value store in a secret manager
1:12:55
and whatever you normally need to for this kind of things they
1:13:02
will provide you. So entire life cycle they have okay and from here you can retrieve the value. You can see the
1:13:07
value come up. Why I can retrieve? because I am logging with root account and I have power to go to my KMS to
1:13:13
decry. So that is I can see otherwise I can't. Okay. So this is one more
1:13:18
service. So as a cloud engineer this still here your role is now further role
1:13:24
is your if you are developers so guy who creating the application or your front end we provide this code if they don't
1:13:32
know how to write the code and they have to use this code in their program that's all. Okay. But from our side we are
1:13:40
securing the and guys understand one thing in this code we don't have any password by chance my code compromise in
1:13:46
the sharing GitHub nobody can see my password because password is coming from
1:13:52
secret database and only the secret database will know the password nobody can okay so this way actually we plan
1:13:59
the security so there's one more service we have that is called uh sec security
1:14:05
manager that's what we have discussed Okay. So, so guys, if you talk about the
1:14:10
bigger um app, okay, we have to lots of things we have to plan, right? A small
1:14:16
small component we have to plan. We have to keep the password. We have to keep our databases
1:14:22
and in which network to use hundreds of thing we have to plan in terms of
1:14:27
performance uh in the terms of latency in the terms of security right then only
1:14:34
my application can be useful. If you create a very beautiful application, okay, but it it had a lot of security
1:14:40
issues, it it can be break, right? So, we have to think in all the angles.
1:14:48
Okay. So guys, this about one more uh service we cover that's called security manager. Okay, these two service we have
1:14:55
covered. Now let's come to our ACM. It's very interesting survey. You definitely like this particular demo. Okay. So this
1:15:03
survey guys will explain you a little bit more about the structure that I covered yesterday. Okay. This called
1:15:10
cryptographic you know SSLTS handing we will little bit discuss little bit more advanc. Okay. So what's my plan? So plan
1:15:18
is something like this. Okay we understood guys yesterday one of the important use case of asymmetric key.
1:15:26
Okay. So guys very quickly let me explain you the discussion what we had
1:15:32
done yesterday and it looked like whatever we had discussed yesterday it looked like it is foolproof setup nobody
1:15:40
can break but in that setup guys we have a very big bug okay and by knowing this
1:15:46
bug anybody can break this setup what I mean by this so let me guys understand uh this concept again so let's say we
1:15:53
have a server here. Okay. And let's say the IP of server is
1:15:58
uh let's say IP of server is is 100. And let's say we have one of the
1:16:05
client. Okay. And uh server one the client will share their login and password
1:16:11
information in very secure. Guys again I want to take one uh your
1:16:18
attention over here. This topic is independent. These two topic whatever discuss is completed. there's no link of
1:16:24
this topic. Okay. So I just want to focus on this topic uh separately
1:16:30
because this concept very important to know. Okay. And lot of guys from couple of days keep asking me to discuss about
1:16:38
CRT, CSR, CA certificates, why we use
1:16:43
and what is use of these and how it work everything going to cover in very detail.
1:16:49
Okay. So uh so what we had discussed yesterday let me very quickly revise and
1:16:54
then I saw you there's one bug or security security loophole in the setup
1:16:59
whatever we discussed yesterday. So our here guys the goal is client has a
1:17:05
password let's say red hat and this password or this data client want to transfer to the server and yesterday
1:17:12
finally what we had discussed how can we transfer. So for this server can create
1:17:17
their private key and server never shared the private key to anyone in the world and server has a public key
1:17:25
public. Okay. So, so um so what we do
1:17:31
whenever client first connect to server server say world is not secure there are
1:17:38
a lot of guys ISP in the companies your packet is going via these companies uh
1:17:44
they can see your data okay so do one thing okay in the first step client come
1:17:50
to server server said do one thing don't share data with HTTP you have to share your data with HTTPS PS and for HTTPS
1:17:58
you require my public key. So in the second step I am sharing my public key to you.
1:18:04
Okay to you. So now finally client will have a server public key. Okay. And now client has server public
1:18:12
key. Now this time client will create their own symmetry key. This client symmetric key and intention guys I
1:18:18
already explain you. Okay. Before client will share this data. Okay. Client want to send their symmetry
1:18:25
key to server. Okay. Because both the parties has the same symmetric key. Okay. So they can
1:18:34
they can each other can communicate to each other. They can well both can communicate with each other securely. And how they transfer this key? So
1:18:41
client use server public key to encrypt this data.
1:18:46
Okay. Okay. So finally this box box created client symmetric key locked with server
1:18:52
public key and I I told you yesterday if you block anything with ser public key nobody can decipher
1:19:00
who has a public private key they can decip. So in the third step we share this data to the server and because
1:19:07
server is the private key that server never share server unlock and finally what server get they get this one mean
1:19:12
they get client symmetry. So finally finally we use public key private key
1:19:18
pair means asymmetric key to transfer a client session key or shared key or
1:19:24
symmetric key whatever you want to say they are the same thing. Okay. Now after
1:19:29
this client can send a data with log with their symmetric key. Server have a
1:19:36
same symmetric key to unlock server will also send some critical information to same symmetric key. By chance nobody in
1:19:42
the middle has the client symmetric key. So they will never break your data. So the further commission guys is purely
1:19:48
encrypted but for encryption they are using and we are using client symmetric. So this
1:19:54
diagram guys we had uh discussed yesterday
1:19:59
it look like it's so much foolproof. Okay. Okay. To consider that if you have
1:20:07
a private key and nobody can break your private key. I
1:20:13
also consider that if you lock anything with public key only way to unlock is
1:20:21
with respect to private key and if you lock any data with symmetric key same symmetric key can unlock.
1:20:29
Okay. So these are the consideration in this setup and this concern is so much foolproof nobody can break till it
1:20:35
otherwise internet never be safe. Everybody, every bank is using internet it means internet is safe. And why
1:20:42
internet safe? Because nobody can break uh these things. If you lock something,
1:20:48
nobody can unlock without the key. If you lock something public key, nobody can unlock without their private key. So
1:20:53
this is foolproof. Test it. And now guys take take this thing in your mind. Okay?
1:21:00
And I want to give you one minute. Just try to look in this diagram again. go to this flow and just try to help me if
1:21:08
this is the setup going in the world. Okay, can we break this setup?
1:21:14
What do you think? Take 1 minute or maybe 2 minutes like 1951 in my laptop.
1:21:19
So after 2 minute I will ask you just go through this diagram and try to think you are somewhere here
1:21:26
in the middle. Okay, every package is going via you
1:21:32
and you have to break means you want to read what password we are sending, what data server client is
1:21:39
sending. Okay, how you can break this?
1:21:44
Just take 2 minute at 1954 in my laptop time. I will ask you what do you think?
1:21:49
How can you break this? But I can give you the guarantee guys. We have a break for this setup, right? This setup can
1:21:56
very easily break. So how if you can guys tell me take two
1:23:20
So somebody saying with the help of men in the middle right that's what I'm asking right if anybody in between want
1:23:27
to do a attack this called men in the middle attack how they can do that's
1:23:32
what I'm asking right how you can do this
1:24:26
Okay. So guys, let me give the answer. I think uh a lot of response I have seen by chance Duris Palar whatever you say
1:24:34
is absolutely right. Uh this is the way we can uh we can break this system.
1:24:41
Okay, break the system. cookies never help you in this way. Okay. So, uh what
1:24:49
how can we break the setup? So, guys, let me explain you how this kind of setup can break. So, again, let's say we
1:24:56
have a server and let's say IP of server is 100. Under one thing, this is the IP of the server
1:25:02
and this is the client uh having some IP address. Okay. And one thing all the packet from
1:25:09
the client go via internet. There is some attacker over here.
1:25:15
Okay, hacker over here. I can say means some cricketer over here. Understand one
1:25:22
thing request guys always started from the client. The Google never come to you. Your Facebook never come to you.
1:25:28
You have to go to Facebook and Google mean client client is the one who create
1:25:35
the packet. Okay. And in the packet client always write the server IP address. Let's say
1:25:41
the IP 100 or Facebook IP or Google IP. Okay. And this is the first packet from
1:25:46
the client goes to the server. And guys, this packet always go via network. And
1:25:53
network we have a lot of devices, a lot of routers coming and they are the one who will forward
1:26:01
your packet next to next ISP and finally your packet reach to IP00.
1:26:07
And when guys packet reach to your server first thing your server see uh to
1:26:13
whom you come for. So insert packet it is written that they want to come to the
1:26:18
destination called IP 100. It's called destination IP and server say yes you reach to the right location and I will
1:26:26
uh reply you whatever you come to me. Okay but you know what hacker do. Okay
1:26:33
because the packet is going by the router. So in the router they might do something here. Okay. And they will
1:26:41
redact this packet to their laptop.
1:26:46
Okay. How? Because they are the attacker. They might have access to this router. Maybe they're working the same
1:26:51
company or maybe some other way also. Sometimes this concept is called root poisoning.
1:26:58
They poison the root. So finally what happened this packet will when they
1:27:04
reach to this router or while going to this path your router will set some
1:27:09
route this called root poisoning and they will send this packet to their laptop or to their particular team of
1:27:16
the hackers. Okay. And now uh what happened when they
1:27:22
reach to the system and this time guys they use a concept called IP
1:27:28
I IP fixing IP or IP cloning kind of thing.
1:27:33
Same laptop guys they give the same IP what IP of the server we can give because you guys know we can give same
1:27:39
IP to other computers also. Okay exactly same IP they provide uh to this system
1:27:45
and lot of tool available in the market to give the same IP and it will work. So when packet reach to this system and
1:27:50
system say from whom you come to this something this packet say I come to IP00
1:27:55
and uh this yes this is my IP address. So I will take this packet and what is this packet uh hidden in this packet it
1:28:02
is written that I want to connect to you. So client technically
1:28:07
technically connected to this laptop and you know guys this laptop has created the exactly same website whatever we
1:28:14
have here creating the same website not big deal it's called website cloning there lot of two level market one click
1:28:20
we can create a clone of Gmail or Google and Facebook okay so they create exact clone and
1:28:26
because this server server can create their own private key and this is not server I can say this is a hacker system
1:28:32
so hacker create their own private key and hacker get their own public key. Okay. And hacker know this is their
1:28:38
public key and private key. Okay. And because client finally lended to the system. So this time guys hacker will
1:28:46
provide their public key. Okay. So finally client will get a public key of the hacker. Understand guys in the
1:28:52
public key is not written that is key come from IP00 real or fake or server or
1:28:58
hacker key is a key and client never know this key come from where. Okay,
1:29:04
because it reply come from IP 100 and client only know server with their IP address. There's no other way client
1:29:10
know the server because reply is coming from IP. So client feel this uh this uh key comes from the real
1:29:18
server. Okay. And this case again server client create their symmetric key they log by
1:29:25
this they reply again my root poisoning my packet come here and hacker system will get the same symmetric key of the
1:29:32
client. Okay. And next time server will provide their website with the exact same copy
1:29:38
of Facebook or Gmail. Client feel this is the real website come up. So they put
1:29:43
their password but this password they lock with the symmetric key they send back to this hacker system and hacker
1:29:50
has the same symmetric key. So they unlock and they get the password. They get the password. Okay. So finally
1:29:58
this concept is normally known as fishing attack. So with the help of fishing attack or with the there's
1:30:04
called men in middle attack also here because somebody in the middle attacking the system. So with the help of fishing attack
1:30:11
hackers can very easily break your data especially your password or maybe they
1:30:16
can do some more intelligent step rather than because they they have a fake website obviously they don't have a real
1:30:22
content of the client. After they ret they they they further proxy their
1:30:29
laptop and connect to the real server. So client field finally they connect to real server. So their communication is
1:30:35
going on the way it goes. But but some but by this approach
1:30:41
hacker get your password and you know after get the password they can break your system. Okay. So technically uh
1:30:48
this is the challenge. Anybody uh by chance come in the middle, okay,
1:30:55
they can fake the IP, okay, they can fake the IP, okay, uh and they can get
1:31:03
your data. Okay, so how we can uh save guard from
1:31:10
this attack or from the fishing attack? Okay. So guys here if you understand the
1:31:16
biggest challenge is biggest challenge is okay how client come to know what a
1:31:23
public key is coming is coming from the real source. So guys here the challenge is okay how
1:31:31
client come to know this public key is coming is coming of the hacker public key or public key is coming from the
1:31:38
server real server public key. So here the challenge guys here is okay how
1:31:44
server can provide their public key to that client
1:31:50
okay if client get the server public key then nobody can break it nobody can even
1:31:55
though they they root poisoning but they don't have a their server private key so nobody can break so challenge in this
1:32:02
setup is okay how we can provide a server public key okay and guys you try
1:32:10
to understand this setup You will find there's no
1:32:15
direct way to provide a server public key. One way is server can mail to the
1:32:21
client or provide in the WhatsApp or SMS that this is a public key stored in your laptop and always use
1:32:28
okay obviously there's not feasible way if you have a bigger clients huge client you have okay so challenge here is
1:32:37
finally I am a server I have my public key how can I provide my public key to
1:32:45
the client technical this concept I will explain Client has symmetric key
1:32:51
that we can provide to the server. So we can do a further communication encrypted with the help of server public key. But
1:32:57
how can we provide uh server public key to the client?
1:33:05
Okay. Because if we try to provide and the client ask you in the network. So my
1:33:10
packet never needs to a real server. Somebody in the attack means they have done some fishing and they can provide
1:33:17
their public key and client never know by seeing the public key that they're not real. Okay. So here here guys in
1:33:23
this setup we have to take the help of third party company.
1:33:28
Okay. A third party company. So you can think in this way. You can think in this way. If you talk about guys web server
1:33:36
web server is always used by a client using a web browser.
1:33:41
Okay. And let's say one of the browser let's say is Firefox or Chrome or Safari. So limited browser we have in the world. Okay. So we will take the
1:33:50
help of browser also. Okay. What I mean by this in a minute I will explain you. Okay. So uh what we do
1:33:58
we take the help of third party company. Okay. And uh and by this third party
1:34:03
company known as CA is called certificate authority CA. Okay. This is some third party
1:34:09
company. We have a lot of company market like ver sign or godaddy and a lot of
1:34:15
company we have who work as a certificate authority. Okay. What their
1:34:20
role is? Okay. These companies say I will help I
1:34:26
will help you as a server to share your public key to the client.
1:34:33
And the way I will share your public key to the client, okay, they will they will genuinely
1:34:40
confirm automatically by some way that this is your public key. Nobody is doing fishing.
1:34:46
If somehow if hacker try to share their public key very quickly they come to
1:34:53
know even though they won't able to connect also because they connect with the help of browser your browser auto
1:34:58
prompt that the key through which you connected is wrong. So connection disconnected there. So IMS I will help
1:35:06
you. I'll help you to share your public key to the client. How? So let me guys
1:35:14
explain you the con process. The process something like this. First of all this CSA. Okay. Just create one packet or one
1:35:24
document. In this document put your company information. put your company
1:35:30
name, your country name, your organization name, your locality or your
1:35:36
company uh uh your system host name means the DNS name and put your public
1:35:42
key here. Create this document. In this document, the most important thing is
1:35:48
your public key and second most important thing is your host name means your DNS. Why it's important? In a
1:35:54
minute, I will explain you. Okay. So create this document okay and and send this document to me
1:36:04
okay and by saying guys this document is known as CSR certificate it's like a certificate or
1:36:11
for signing request certificate signing request send this document to me and I
1:36:16
am a C I'm very famous in the market right everybody in the world rely on us
1:36:23
okay because of our reparison okay so I am the who do something here and what we do uh
1:36:29
in this certificate this is known as CSR okay because I'm very famous so uh so I
1:36:36
will sign this certificate and why these guys say I am very famous
1:36:43
okay because all the browser in the world rely on me for example there's one browser called Firefox
1:36:51
Firefox rely on me there's one browser Chrome let's say Chrome let's LS god is
1:36:57
a company. So Chrome rely on okay why they rely because whenever this
1:37:02
software come in the market who use the software my client so in this software
1:37:08
okay I put my identity this called CA certificate CA certificate
1:37:15
so because of my identity they know me who are me so why I'm saying I am very famous all the browser in the world
1:37:22
right any browser in the world who use who used by client okay so I put my
1:37:28
internal information my internal uh certificate here especially there's
1:37:33
known as fingerprint finger means is a unique identity of mine I put here why how is useful I will explain you okay so
1:37:40
it means let's say this is a godaddy so chrome know about me or firefox know
1:37:48
about me and who use this browser client and from where the client get this
1:37:53
browser right from their OS So example right now I'm using OS like let's say
1:37:59
Windows and let's say Windows by default give me for example Firefox or Chrome for example or maybe Edge.
1:38:05
Okay. So technically if you talk about your client client will always use OS
1:38:11
and OS is the one they use they provide the browser and what browser contain they contain
1:38:18
some information about famous CA that's called certificate authority
1:38:24
okay and they have some CA certificate what the use of the certificate I will explain in a minute CA certificate so
1:38:30
technically all the laptops all the mobile phones already have
1:38:36
CA certificate. So all the CA in the world they have their information. Okay.
1:38:44
So that's what the CA is saying. But I am very famous. Everybody know me. So send your server. Let's say you are
1:38:51
Facebook. You create your own public key. Put your private key with you only.
1:38:56
Don't share this private key to anyone also not to me also. Okay? Keep with
1:39:02
you. Share it public key to me. Okay. Okay, I will sign and I sign means I
1:39:09
sign means I look at your company information that you are Facebook, your domain is wwfas.com.
1:39:15
Okay, so I'll check all my older record or other companies also. I found there's
1:39:20
no other company with wfas.com. Okay, you are the one. I will check your identity. I will confirm and then I'll
1:39:27
sign. Okay. And after sign, I will provide this certificate to you and put
1:39:32
this certificate in your browser. And guys, when the server sign then this certificate known as CRT, signing
1:39:38
Chinese rem reminder theorem, but this is called certificate signed by CA and
1:39:43
keep this certificate in the browser. Now the interesting role now come. So finally what we have okay some famous CA
1:39:51
signed my certificate. Okay. And then certificate I keep in my browser. Let's
1:39:56
say Facebook is a website. they keep in their server. Okay. Now here, now from
1:40:02
here, this is the actual setup we had already. Okay. Now in this communication
1:40:07
guys, nobody can break our process. Why?
1:40:13
Because as soon as as soon as my client uh type wfas.com
1:40:22
my request go to Facebook and Facebook reply me with the
1:40:30
certificate it's called C. So they never reply me public key over the Facebook in
1:40:35
public key they reply me is entire packet or entire certificate they contain all of my details of the company
1:40:42
plus my public key that's client looking for plus the signature of the se. So
1:40:48
finally finally the signature reach to the client or this packet reach to the
1:40:54
client. So client what they contain they get entire detail uh company name organization
1:41:02
their details uh Facebook public key and signature of
1:41:08
CA here they also write that I am a very sign or I am a god.
1:41:14
So what your client browser for example Firefox say Firefox go in their internal
1:41:19
database and they try to find does they know about God they say yes. Do you have
1:41:25
any certificate signature with this one? So there's a
1:41:31
mechanism guys here called fingerprinting finger uh finger uh print it's called hashing. There's some
1:41:37
hashing method. I'm not going to that direction but the way they check uh the
1:41:42
way they check is they say I already know the signature and this signature is
1:41:48
exactly you know like we do in bank right when you issue a DD or so check.
1:41:53
So bank has your signature and somebody has this dd has a signature. So this is like a check and
1:42:00
firefox is a bank and bank has all the signature of all the CAS or all their accounts.
1:42:06
So they match the signature and they find the signature is matched. This means this is the actual certificate
1:42:13
signed by the CA that is I know that is famous CA. It means nobody has done some
1:42:18
changes here. So this public key is very much right. I can use this public key.
1:42:24
Okay, I use this public key and further complexing I I will explain you after get the public key we can do the further
1:42:29
thing. Okay, but let's say in this process in this process if hacker try to break
1:42:36
the system. So hack caner also create the public key. They can also create uh their
1:42:42
certificate called CSR. They put the public key here
1:42:47
or they can also send the public this certificate called CSR to the CA. They can send because the CA
1:42:55
these CA are the company they're doing their business. So whenever asked to sign they will actually uh charge you.
1:43:03
So if you go to godaddy or if you go to xy side there a lot of ca available in the market. So if you go to those
1:43:09
companies they normally charge they charge you yearly basis or monthly basis
1:43:14
or they charge for one month after 1 month they expire for example there
1:43:20
would be uh just for example so I think there's a name.com
1:43:27
okay uh I think here in SSL I don't know this is working or not
1:43:35
so yeah so there are a lot of company
1:43:40
sorry it's called comedo rapid SSL so these are the some of the
1:43:46
companies uh who provide SSL certificate SS technically known as CRT certificate
1:43:54
technically it means these are the CA you provide your uh public key with CSR
1:44:00
they will sign and for signing they charge you this much price 10,000 rupees a year or some
1:44:07
dollars per year basis and this is per year after year this expire again you to again you to pay the fees right there a
1:44:15
lot of company in the market who doing uh this vis same way uh same way your
1:44:21
hacker also create a certificate they provide the
1:44:27
they provide the uh the certificate and they pay the amount also but here guys why
1:44:35
NCA tried to sign But they don't sign it. They fail. And why they fail?
1:44:40
Because they say I'm asking you I'm asking you uh to provide your company
1:44:46
information. Okay. And plus I'm also ask asking you to provide your DNS name.
1:44:54
Okay. Understand guys. Uh understand one thing DNS is very different server. And
1:45:00
because in the DNS if you Facebook has buy a domain fb.com facebook.com same
1:45:06
domain nbody none of the body in the world can use okay so if this guy want to put the
1:45:13
domain name facebook.com because they want to fish the that particular facing that particular site okay so so uh CSA
1:45:22
this domain I already signed that belong to facebook.com and I know the company details locality their address you are
1:45:28
not that same company means you're going to fish that uh fishing that particular site. So I will I won't sign this
1:45:35
certificate. So none of the famous CA will sign a certificate for this hacker
1:45:40
if they're trying to sign a CSR that belong to a domain name that is
1:45:47
already exist okay and that is the reason guys that is a reason okay we always
1:45:55
recommend all the client in the world whenever you want to connect to Facebook or Google or anybody in the world don't
1:46:02
use the IP address always use the host name or the domain. Even though guys, if
1:46:08
you try to connect Gmail or Facebook site with their IP address, most of the feature might not work. Okay, very
1:46:15
quickly, for example, if I try to find NS
1:46:21
lookup of w.gmail.com
1:46:27
this IP come up. Whatever IP4 come up guys if you try to connect their IP
1:46:33
address okay to the browser it won't work okay whatever IP in my case I have
1:46:38
IP6 setup here but whatever IP come up if try to connect Gmail sites or some most of site it won't come up it won't
1:46:46
connect okay because because all of your CA sign the certificate by looking at in
1:46:54
the certificate with your DNS it's called normally known as common name. So every certificate has a common name and
1:47:00
mostly the common name is your DNS name. So hacker won't get the same name
1:47:05
because you know I we have discussed already in registry route 53. If I have
1:47:10
some domain, same domain name nobody can buy in the world. So hacker won't get
1:47:16
use the same host name or same domain name. So CA won't sign and because CA won't sign and without the signing
1:47:23
certificate my browser detect. So if hacker if client is sending the packet
1:47:30
and hacker do road poisoning my request come up here and they provide their certificate
1:47:37
to the client client never use public key till the time they verify certificate. So they see the certificate
1:47:43
and see the certificate is not signed by none of the famous CA that I know signage don't match even though there's
1:47:50
way guys you can create your own CA also server can create your own CA they can set their own certificate this called
1:47:56
self-signed self-signed certificate but this this CA is not famous so browser
1:48:02
very quickly detect that I don't know about this CA and you know sometime in the browser you see some kind of error
1:48:08
come up when you exercise inside with HTTPS they say I don't know who This there might be some fishing attack do
1:48:14
you want to proceed? That would be your your risk. So that that certificate actually signed by somebody else and
1:48:20
they were not signed by some of the famous that your browser know. Okay. So technically if you try to see this
1:48:26
entire setup okay this is called PKI public key infrastructure
1:48:33
where we are taking the help of CA who will sign the certificate. Okay. This is
1:48:40
called PKI public key infrastructure where we helping the taking the help of
1:48:45
C. Okay. And when C signed the certificate technically is known as CRT
1:48:50
certificate but normally CRT name looks a little bit complex. So nowadays we normally use the word called SSL
1:48:57
certificate. Okay. And this will help us to foolproof
1:49:03
our security because challenge is we have to provide our public key to our
1:49:10
client. After client will get a public key nobody can able to break it. So guys, if you go to your browser, I'm not
1:49:16
opening my browser, but go to browser setting setting. Okay, and if you search for
1:49:24
certificate uh certificate in the setting, I'm not opening because I have a lot of cookies
1:49:30
also here. So if you go to security, you can get all the certificate of your CAS.
1:49:39
Okay. So all the famous in the market your browser have their certificate.
1:49:45
Certify means in the simple term in the simple term you can think uh you can think they have the signature.
1:49:52
Okay. Or anybody any company their cert signed by their CA your browser know or
1:49:59
in this case guys they will never give the error in this in this case normally get this symbol you know see in the top
1:50:05
can this symbol or if I go to Facebook what you see this lock this log means
1:50:12
this lock means this lock means your browser is telling
1:50:19
you this that I go to Facebook they provide me
1:50:25
their certificate this called CRT or SSL certificate in this certificate Facebook has their
1:50:31
own Facebook public key that I have to use to do a encryption I
1:50:38
am a client to the Facebook but before I get my public key of the Facebook
1:50:44
okay I will go inside the certificate I check the signature and this certificate he signed by some
1:50:51
CA some company. Okay. And that company signature I
1:50:56
already have in my browser in some of my settings. I compared both the signature
1:51:02
it find same. It means whatever certified Facebook send me is signed by realc. But because it's signed by real I
1:51:10
verified it means the public key that is sent in this certificate is reliable.
1:51:15
Nobody is doing a fishing because nobody can use the same domain name and signed by the real CA. So I can use the public
1:51:22
key and after this water guys process you have discussed as called TLSS hands will go on. Okay, that easy reason guys.
1:51:30
If you click on this button you will see connection secure and you can see
1:51:36
certificate is valid. Okay. And if you click here now it is
1:51:42
very clearly mentioned here. Okay. This survey issue to this domain guys never we never ask you the certificate of IP
1:51:47
address the survey issue to facebook.com and who issue there's some CA called
1:51:54
DJert so dert is one of the CA who issue and they normally issue guys with some
1:52:00
time range of one year or two year depend okay and if you see the detail of the certificate okay in certificate I
1:52:07
told you who signed the certificate is called issuer so there's one company called is
1:52:12
one of the C very famous C who signed the certificate of Facebook valid form
1:52:18
valid to subject content all the thing you know I told you guys when your company has ever you want to send a
1:52:25
certificate to the CA you have to provide your country name your state
1:52:30
your locality your organization your your DNS name that is very important
1:52:36
this also known as common name and plus in the certificate what they provide Facebook provide their public as some
1:52:42
more enforcer. Okay. So these information they put in this box this
1:52:48
called CSR we send to CA which CA they send to the CA they check everything
1:52:55
they sign. Okay. And this because they sign that is reason this name come up here. That's all. Okay. And so browser
1:53:03
guys use this certificate to retrieve the public key
1:53:08
and and this session guys browser create a session key symmetric and do all the
1:53:16
transaction that I explained to you. So this guys and detailed process is
1:53:21
going on is going on. So guys can you hold for a second please?
1:53:33
So this is guys a complete process of CA. So that's all guys. If you see any website you can see the CA. But if you
1:53:40
see some of the website okay where this lock is giving error it means your
1:53:46
browser is find out whatever certificate uh come from this website. Okay, it
1:53:54
signed but the CA who signed my browser don't know either the CA was not so much
1:54:01
famous or somebody has done create their own CA and they signed their own certificate this called uh self-signed
1:54:08
certificate okay so that time your browser will normally first time when you connect they give you error a
1:54:14
warning and they say now it is your risk you want to go ahead you can go otherwise you can uh skip this side
1:54:22
Okay. So that's the uh point how it work. Okay. Now why I explain this concept in detail, right? Because
1:54:29
because the final summary is if you use any of the CA
1:54:35
any of the CA okay first of all you have to pay the amount like god and something
1:54:43
like for your SSL certificate. Okay. Plus you also have to create your
1:54:48
own public key. You have to create your own CSR
1:54:55
send your certificate they sign they provide a CRT means C SS certificate and
1:55:01
they sign for one year after one year you set expire you know after certificate expire all the browser
1:55:06
starts showing the error fail fail fail the certify is failed okay so it's not good for company
1:55:12
repetition to have this kind of red uh you know screen here in the top so again
1:55:18
you go to see again pay they again renew and you start using the new certificate. So, so technically you have to pay every
1:55:25
year. Management is very harder. You have to create your own certificate. Provisioning your own certificate is
1:55:30
very much uh tedious task sometime especially the renewal task is very
1:55:35
tedious. Okay. And that easy reason guys Amazon recently come up with a new
1:55:41
service called ACM. Okay. What they say now everything we
1:55:48
will manage for you. Okay. So, uh anything relative certificate, if you want to create your
1:55:55
own certificate called CSR, I will create for you. Okay. If you want to
1:56:01
sign the certificate, create a CRT or SLS certificate. I will sign for you
1:56:06
because I am the now I'm a famous company. I am also now work as a CA real
1:56:12
certificate authority. So, I will sign for you. I will say I have sign for one year and after one year certificate
1:56:18
expire I will again resign for you. you don't have to worry about so entire
1:56:24
management of a certificate or you need see everything I will do for you and the
1:56:30
mo most interesting thing is entire process is free you don't have to pay anything to the Amazon and that is
1:56:37
service called Amazon certificate manager okay entire process is absolutely free
1:56:44
for us so creating a certificate is called provisioning managing signing everything can be done by one service
1:56:51
called ACA. Okay. So that's what guys the use of
1:56:56
ACM. Let me show you this demo. Even though working in this service is so simple. Okay. So if I so search for ACM is
1:57:03
certificate manager. It manage launch new and deploy sign everything they do
1:57:10
for you. Okay. So I already have one set up for one domain. So that's not important. So
1:57:18
let me request for a new certificate. Okay. And here they give you option
1:57:23
called uh import certificate. So I said they are going to manage. So if your
1:57:29
company has already your certificate that by signed by some third party CA you can import and they will manage for
1:57:34
you. Okay. But if you want to create everything from the scratch okay you can click on create request.
1:57:42
One minute. create request
1:57:48
click now here they're asking you do you already have a certificate sign you can
1:57:53
import here but I don't want to create a new so let me create a public means uh publicly anybody can use so public
1:58:01
certificate tested web by browser that's what I'm talking about and guys not browser OS also same same concept we always also use
1:58:08
with uh software also so you know sometime you buy a software you double clicking in the windows and windows
1:58:13
prompt you when you they install software they say this software known this software known by this company or
1:58:19
by Oracle do you want to install or not? So why Windows can prompt you? Because they your Windows OS or Linux OS already
1:58:26
has all the certificate signed by these companies mean all the
1:58:32
CS certificate they have. Okay. So normally public means normally the websites and OS they use this. So that's
1:58:38
what I want to create here. Okay. So this one. So before guys I I'll
1:58:44
go and create creating sur is so simple no big deal no big deal but here you
1:58:49
should know understand what actually we are going on right so you know my plan is something like this and as I need 15
1:58:56
20 more minute it's very powerful demo I would like to show you here so my demo is something like this I'm going to
1:59:05
launch two web servers in the EC2 instances
1:59:12
Okay, how to launch? You guys know pretty straightforward. Well, guys, very very interesting demo. You will
1:59:18
definitely like this. Okay, so initiative in I I have a AMI.
1:59:27
Okay, so AMI we already created. So I'm going to use my AMI this one and this by
1:59:34
this I'm going to launch two instances. Why? In a minute I will explain you.
1:59:42
Okay, two instances. Let's say this web server for ACM.
1:59:50
Let me allow all. You guys know about this service. Okay.
1:59:58
And launch. So two instance I'm launching this uh has a web server.
2:00:03
Okay. And because why launch two? Because I my plan is to create a load balancer.
2:00:09
So I'm going to use ELB and I create a load balancer here. And
2:00:14
you guys know when you create ELB, ELB provide you IP address. But you guys know they never provide IP address. They
2:00:20
normally provide you the DNS name. So any client come to this DNS.
2:00:27
Any client come to this DNS okay name. Behind the scene my load balancer will
2:00:33
balance the load either they send here and they send here this part you know. But because this
2:00:39
is your web server. Okay. So my load balancer behind the scene connect with the protocol called HTTP and HTTP
2:00:47
and because obviously client want to connect to the finally web server. So client also come via HTTP.
2:00:54
But if you see guys here everything is unsecure. Okay. Anybody right can uh get
2:01:00
your data. Okay. But at least one thing this part is secure
2:01:06
because instances load balancer is inside the AWS data center inside my VPC
2:01:11
and you guys know nobody can enter in your VPC even physically also that we can rely on AWS data center. Okay. So if
2:01:20
anybody try to break this data we can rely on AWS that nobody can go at this
2:01:25
network connection and can see your data. So this part somehow is very reliable but client is there on the
2:01:31
internet. client is there on the internet and uh and uh my ELB
2:01:38
uh has a public IP or public DNS. So client will go via HTTP. Here anybody can break your data. So communication
2:01:45
between the client and the ELB I want encrypted is called HTTPS.
2:01:53
Okay. So, so understand one thing you guys know already when a client want to connect they always connect to ELB for
2:02:00
so for the client ELB let's say ELB IP is let's say 100 so ELB work as a server
2:02:08
and for the client ELB work as a server okay so ELB is the one that require a
2:02:14
certificate CRT or I can say CRT or maybe SS certificate
2:02:20
okay so while configuring the ELB okay we have to ELB whenever any client connect to you
2:02:26
connect to you okay they feel you are a server you until you proceed there's a different point but they feel you are a
2:02:32
server so when client connect to you you have to provide your certificate then client will get your ELB public key and
2:02:41
they will do the same thing but the certificate you provide is cr is mean your certificate is signed by somebody
2:02:46
okay and who will sign c in our case here c would be a cm service So this guy
2:02:56
will uh sign for his asim service. Okay, this is one thing. So I'll tell my
2:03:03
client means I'll tell my ELB that I'm I'm creating your ELB. Okay, and till
2:03:11
that guys if you remember in ELB when you configure load balancer, you always give a port number. Let's say we give
2:03:18
the port number 80. Okay, this called front end port or the load balancer port and it is also known
2:03:24
as listener. So till guys we have given a listener of port number 80 of HTTP.
2:03:32
Okay. But now today what I'm going to do here if I use 80 normally they work on HT port. Okay. Today I'm going to change
2:03:39
the listener and I'm going to change to HTTPS means ELB you only listen on HTTPS
2:03:45
and guys typically HTTPS work on port number 443 right? That's what I'm going to do. And
2:03:50
when you ask ELB to work on this particular port number,
2:03:56
work on this particular port number. So or I asked my LB to work on HTTPS. So ELB first thing they ask you if I want
2:04:03
if you want me to work on HTTPS means on secure I need a certificate. So you have
2:04:09
to provide me a signed certificate by some CA. Okay. So either you go to god or
2:04:16
somewhere else you create your own certificate sign provide here or I can
2:04:21
go to ACM okay create a certificate and provide to this guy okay so let me show
2:04:27
you very quickly you guys know how to create a uh create a ELB so uh this is
2:04:35
my load balancer let me create a new load balancer I'm
2:04:41
going for uh maybe application load balancer maybe or maybe you can go for older also
2:04:47
or now actually they do launch new one also gateway let me go for older one you can use anything and guys here this is
2:04:54
I'm talking about so let's say this is my elb for let's say this is ACM okay
2:05:01
and uh I want this will I don't want this load balancer can connect to outside world
2:05:07
with port okay I want they will connect via HTTPS PS that's what that's what I
2:05:15
want and guys the automatic 443 port come up so technically what I'm going to do my front end port number for load
2:05:23
balancer is 443 HTTPS and behind the scene they will further communicate with
2:05:28
the same port number ID because this network is secure so we can go for this otherwise you can also make this also
2:05:34
HTTPS if you make this HTTPS then you have to manage some extra server also in your instances that you have to manage
2:05:40
because this is your server you are passing server that you have to manage. So I'm just going for HTTP only. So my
2:05:47
load balancer port is 443. My back end is normally HTTP. Okay. Click next.
2:05:55
This is a security group you guys know. Okay. And now guys this new option come
2:06:00
up till our in till in our last class you never see this option. And here they
2:06:07
are talking about your load balancer need a certificate.
2:06:13
Okay. Again, initially we are managing certificate in IM right now new service
2:06:19
come up. Now we manage certificate in but if you have your certificate in IM service you can get provide here. Okay.
2:06:26
But right now I would like to provide a certificate from ACM service.
2:06:31
Okay. So this they're talking about you have certificate from here by chance. In my case I had one certificate already
2:06:40
this one. Okay. So they show me you want to use this certificate but I don't want to use
2:06:45
this one. I want to create a new right now. So so I can show you the demo. Okay. So guys finally plan is my plan is
2:06:53
I want anybody in the world can connect to my load balancer. they
2:06:59
will connect via HTTPS and for this to my load balancer I have to provide a
2:07:04
certificate signed by some CA most probably in my case I'm going to use ACM
2:07:10
service okay that's what I'm going to use so technically my load balancer is not yet configured so let me cancel I
2:07:17
will again come back to this screen to configure my load balancer okay one more
2:07:22
thing I want to tell you here is okay whenever you create a load balancer
2:07:29
they create a DNS name okay and every time guys your DNS name
2:07:36
change and you don't have a control in this DNS and that is the reason that is the reason what normally we do we create
2:07:44
route 53 okay and route 53 guys we fix our domain
2:07:50
name okay so let's say we prep purchase one domain name and guys for this demo by chance I already done this thing for
2:07:56
you for this demo Okay, I'm going to route 53 and one domain I
2:08:03
already purchased. And what is route 53 guys? We had already discussed in very detail.
2:08:09
So one new domain I already purchased. Okay. So if you go here, so one new
2:08:18
domain I just now I purchased already. Oh my god, it is uh still in the
2:08:25
pending. So
2:08:33
there's some issue in verification. I think payment is not yet processed. Okay. So let's let's go for this do. So
2:08:41
this domain we already purchased riceworld.com. So what I'm going to do
2:08:47
I'm creating a a new record in my router and say if anybody come to load balancer
2:08:56
rinuxorld.com if anybody come to this domain this is a simple domain to go will automatically
2:09:03
guys redirected to this load balancer the
2:09:09
load balancer that I'm going to get. The guys this concept as we already discussed so we had reacted to this one or whatever load balancer we had
2:09:15
created. Okay. So let me very quickly create the load balancer okay to show this demo. So I'm going for guys by
2:09:22
default elbm with uh with normal HTTP only. I will
2:09:30
come back to this load balance again one more time. Okay. But this con we already discussed. So I'm doing little bit
2:09:37
faster. Click. Click. I think I had a page index.php, I
2:09:43
believe. Okay. And
2:09:48
this one and I'm going to attach two of these instances as my back end
2:09:57
tag review and create. So this load balancer has been created
2:10:02
and guys you know when you create load balancer this name come up and next time my name will be changed. So I'll go to
2:10:08
my DNS and say I don't want to use this name. I I want to fix my name. So anybody come
2:10:14
to this name behind the scene this name to be converted in this bigger name. It would be anything or next time it will
2:10:21
change it would be anything. Okay. So as you guys know this is called common name
2:10:26
because this is the AWS resources. So AS know about their name. So this common name here is known as alias. So we can
2:10:33
go to DNS and create alias. Let me show you very quickly again because this part we had already done.
2:10:39
So I'll go to my my hoster zone of route 53.
2:10:47
Okay. This is my domain name is a public anybody in the world can use.
2:10:52
Okay. And I'm going to create one record here. A record is if anybody come to this domain lw sorry llb.xsworld.com.
2:11:03
Okay. come to this record. I'll create a record for alias
2:11:12
is AW resources. Okay. And uh Walmart where alias
2:11:19
comical name and where the option of alias yeah alias.
2:11:27
Okay. And they know because these are AW resources. So they they know they can
2:11:32
pick from from other services and this services is
2:11:40
I launch where in Mumbai.
2:11:47
Come on to uh why my alias is
2:11:55
it should work. So this is working. It's why why they
2:12:01
not showing in Mumbai
2:12:08
format. So C name where the last option okay let me
2:12:15
directly put this ls we have already seen in my route. I don't know why this name is not coming. So let me manually
2:12:22
copy this name and write here. Pretty simple right? So anybody come to
2:12:28
this name behind the scene this name come to this name and they can connect. Okay. So this one simple record I would
2:12:35
like to create here. Record created. So this is what we have
2:12:41
done already. So anybody who come to this name finally they
2:12:47
lended to this name. Okay. And if I use cmd just to check ns look up
2:12:55
about this one. Just to confirm there's a live DNS or real DNS.
2:13:02
Okay. By guys in my setup here I have some IPv6 setup. So there's the issue come up. But if you use some other
2:13:08
services like online you can see this name is converted to this name. Okay.
2:13:14
Now technically if anybody come to this name they connect to this name and
2:13:19
because this name is a load balancer. Okay. And if you see this load balancer,
2:13:25
this load balancer connected to two instances. Okay. And they are in service. So
2:13:34
technically my load balancer has been in service. So very quickly I want to check my this setup. Very simple setup.
2:13:41
Have anybody come to here? They can see my website. So either they come to this load balancer I host name or they come
2:13:50
to this name is same thing. So which one? This one. The same thing. Let me
2:13:56
check again. See guys, exactly working. So I can't
2:14:01
give this bigger name to my customer. I can give this more name look like very simple. This is my company domain name
2:14:08
and anybody in the world even though guys is public you can also try. But if you notice here in the top right now it
2:14:15
says not secure connection is not secure. That's what guys I plan today. Okay. So this this
2:14:23
line say okay you are connected to this domain and if you see the the protocol
2:14:29
is HTTP and technically we know our setup we
2:14:34
know our setup our setup is something like this something like this very quickly let me
2:14:41
write. So when client connect they go to actually my load balancer
2:14:48
again that connection is by HTTP and my load will again behind the scene connect with some server there's a different but
2:14:56
the client perspective wherever they're connecting maybe load balance of a server it is HTTP so I am a
2:15:02
client so my client I browser saying is not secure
2:15:08
okay so now what we have to do Okay, we have to do only one thing. I'll tell my load balancer the client is the one who
2:15:15
going to connect to you. Connect to you. I they don't want to use HTTP. So what you have to do? Okay,
2:15:23
change your HTTP protocol or 8 port number 80 because you're listening in
2:15:28
this port. Change this and convert to HTTPS that normally work on 443 port.
2:15:35
Then I will ask my client that don't use HTTP, use HTTPS so they can they can connect to you and
2:15:41
that is secure. So my guys plan here is pretty simple. I want I will tell my client don't use this use HTTPS.
2:15:50
But right now if I type HTTPS manually here it will fail. You can see keep moving behind the scene they are trying
2:15:56
to connect to this side. therefore refuse because my 443 HTTPS is not
2:16:03
running in my load balancer. So if you want load balancer this this
2:16:10
one so for this you have to provide a certificate to the load balancer.
2:16:16
Okay. And if you want to create a certificate you have to go to ACM service. Okay. But as service say I will create a
2:16:23
certificate for you. But in the certificate, okay, certificate one important thing we need is a common name
2:16:30
means your DNS name. So do you have a DNS name? Lo say Lord
2:16:37
say yes I have the DNS name. Okay, I have the DNS name this one. But
2:16:44
challenge here is right now this DNS this one but next time my DNS name will change.
2:16:49
Okay. So I can't rely on the maybe after reboot after some time my DNS changed. So I can't rely on this. That is the
2:16:56
reason I changed this DNS to this DNS because this DNS name we
2:17:03
have provided because this our domain name we purchased already and this is public also and this DNS name never
2:17:09
change. Okay. Okay. And that is the reason I tell my load balancer that I have
2:17:14
provided you a fixed public DNS that's called our Linux world.com.
2:17:20
Okay. And because.com is owned by us. Our DNS is also owned by us. Nobody in
2:17:26
the world can have this because it is a requirement in the CA. Whatever certificate you provide, it should
2:17:31
contain public key. There is one point. But it also require your DNS name and they always recommend use a DNS name
2:17:37
that never change. If they change, the certificate won't work. Okay. And that's what guys ACM is asking
2:17:43
to you. So what I'm doing here, I'm go to ACM again. Again, create a
2:17:48
certificate. Okay. And here they asking you tell me
2:17:54
tell me the domain. And here guys, we have to provide a domain name that you think you
2:18:00
own. So domain name that I own here is rinuxorld.com.
2:18:07
Okay, this is the domain name that we own. That's all. Okay. This is the one thing you can do. Okay. Anybody who know
2:18:15
about wild card certificate also they also support this. It's good thing. Normally guys in the market if you go
2:18:22
for wild card certificate they charge you extra. They'll charge you a lot. Again this is free. They don't charge
2:18:29
you for the wild card certificate. Especially in the dynamic world. If you know guys about Kubernetes we have a
2:18:34
route. We have a uh we have a you know as services every route we have a
2:18:41
different domain but for every domain we can't create a multiple certificate so we can write staracle.com
2:18:48
this is exactly Facebook also using you know start.fas.com facebook.com. So see you normally charge a lot for
2:18:53
wild card but here it is also free. Okay. Click next. Now here they say
2:19:01
anybody can type this domain name. How we know? I'm a CA I'm a good I'm a Amazon here. How I know this domain
2:19:07
owned by you? So here you have to validate either we send a mail. So any email
2:19:13
register with your domain name we mail you to to to validate or if this DNS is
2:19:19
owned by you. Okay, you can do a validation with DNS and how I click
2:19:25
next. We click next. Okay, and when I confirm okay so here guys they create
2:19:34
they give you a one document this document.
2:19:40
Okay, they say if this DNS is owned by you, go and create this record in your
2:19:46
DNS. Okay, and guys understand one thing. The only one who can create this record in
2:19:52
the DNS. It's just a record and normal record. Just if you go to DNS, you go to DNS, you just go and create a record
2:19:59
like this. Okay, so name of the record is this one.
2:20:06
Okay. And the value is this one. this random value they give you. Okay. They say if you able to create this record
2:20:15
okay so I can confirm you this domain is by you. Okay. So you can click continue. After
2:20:21
this I will go through DNS try to find this record there. If there it means this DNS is owned by you because because
2:20:28
you are owner and owner is the one who can create the record. Okay. So that's what guys this has been
2:20:34
done. So this process guys is already done by me. It take normally some minute after you continue. So what I'm doing
2:20:40
here I'm just again going to my ACM just close this page because this process
2:20:46
guys I already done here by chance they done one more time but this one is done
2:20:52
already. Okay so this done already it takes some minute I don't know okay actually I
2:20:59
continue this that was already there in the record. So they add one more time. Okay. So finally what happened here
2:21:07
behind the scene ACM has created a CRT for me means we have public key and
2:21:13
signed by Amazon is issued by Amazon. Amazon is C. Okay. So that's what I need here. So I
2:21:20
need a certificate right now. Certificate is managed by provisioned by signed by ASM service
2:21:27
called Amazon. Now this certificate we can use anywhere and my plan is to use certificate in my load balancer.
2:21:34
How? Let me go to so creating a certificate and sign is so simple and it's also free. Now I can go very
2:21:40
quickly to my load balancer and say load balancer right now you're listening on port number 80. I want you change your
2:21:47
listener. I don't want anybody can listen on port number 80. Click edit and
2:21:52
I want anybody come to you. they can come on this port and guys see here as soon I change the HTTP this
2:21:59
option automatically come up and here I can click on change and here
2:22:05
they asking you where your certificate copy paste here or if you ACM just click here
2:22:11
in ACM just provide which certificate you have let me use this one okay that's
2:22:16
all that's the only thing you have to do here okay and save okay and save also so Now,
2:22:27
now my load balancer according to this diagram uh so my client from the
2:22:35
outside they can connect to load balancer on https and when they connect to https my load
2:22:40
balancer will provide work as a server they provide a certificate this one in
2:22:45
the certificate we have public key plus csi this CA is a emergency CA if my browser
2:22:53
know Okay, they use check the signature emergency with the certificate signature match they validate they use the public
2:23:00
key and further combination between the load balancer and the client is public is encrypted okay but between the load balancer and
2:23:07
the backend server is again https because that what we have written here
2:23:12
behind this we can change also this one but normally internal network is secure
2:23:17
we don't want to change and if you use https again https again come with lot
2:23:25
lot of uh uh load in the terms of performance because every time you have to encap decrypt so unwanted extra
2:23:31
performance issue will come up. So normally for the performance perspective we don't recommend but if you think your
2:23:37
data might not be secure very critical banking data again we can do one more time HTTPS but it will unwanted hit your
2:23:44
performance. So technically your Intel server is not secure but load balancer will make your
2:23:52
server secure between the public client and this concept is called SSL overloading.
2:23:59
So so we are doing this setup over here. So
2:24:04
let me show you guys finally output. So now last time
2:24:11
if you try to connect this side it were working. Let me again
2:24:18
refresh it is not working or let me open that terminal. Okay. Last time it was not working. If you connect now guys you
2:24:25
can see this message come up. Okay. And this message say your
2:24:31
connection is not private. If you go to advance. Okay,
2:24:38
they say u one small mistake I did not mistake actually uh I also want to show
2:24:44
you they say that you are connecting to this domain
2:24:50
okay but certificate is signed with this doain
2:24:56
okay so what technique they're talking about the certificate that I signed
2:25:03
sign is for this domain Okay. But you are connecting to this
2:25:11
host name. So technically you certificate it's
2:25:17
signed by CA is is signed with a public key but it's not matching the domain. So I can give you guarantee you are this
2:25:23
certificate is fake or not. Even though if you click on the top you can see now certificate come up and survey is
2:25:29
invalid. Sign by provide Amazon by issue to this domain. But I'm trying to connect with
2:25:35
other doain. But you can proceed here. Proceed means you say that's okay. Uh I don't want you
2:25:43
verify. I just want to get the public key
2:25:48
of my server and with this public key I will start encrypting. But they might be guarantee not guarantee some hacker
2:25:54
might try to provide this one. So what I'm trying to tell you here is if you want to uh exercise with this
2:26:02
domain so while creating a certificate let me create one more time one more certificate.
2:26:08
Okay, here you should be very specific uh that you want to create a certificate for this domain.
2:26:15
Either you can use wild card okay the the the way I already told you
2:26:21
or you can specify that I am currently certified for this with this do click next to validate this a new domain come
2:26:28
up review okay confirm and now they say if you want to validate
2:26:35
okay just provide put this thing in your DNS let me put this thing in my DNS to
2:26:41
validate so my DNS is where yeah here it
2:26:47
So I'm going to go to my my DNS. I'm going to record create one record and
2:26:54
record would be this one. Okay. So you have to copy this one from here till
2:27:00
here or let me copy entire
2:27:06
and paste it. This this doain already added. So let me
2:27:11
remove last one. this one. Okay. And
2:27:18
this is the C name because they ask to put the C name and
2:27:23
this value this way.
2:27:29
So this way way because you're adding a new value, it means you have power to do something in DNS. It means you own this
2:27:36
DNS. Okay. And because you own this DNS, now they can validate.
2:27:42
and let's continue. Okay. So,
2:27:50
so they validate and this come right. So now if I go to
2:27:56
my the pending is validation it takes some minute. Yeah quickly this why very
2:28:03
good speedily they have done and they have validated or they certificate there's a new
2:28:10
certificate come up. So a small change I have to do in my uh load balancer. Okay,
2:28:15
I've changed my check tell my load balance I have to change your certificate from ACM and certificate I'm
2:28:21
going to use is this one. Okay, this one that's all. Now I can I'm
2:28:30
pretty sure if anybody now come to my website. Okay. So let me again connect is there
2:28:38
only is Linux world.com. Okay. Hit. Now guess here there's no
2:28:44
error command. So much clean. Okay. One click everything work fine. And they say
2:28:50
the site they're connecting is so secure. See here lock symbol. There's no error. And click here. This is valid
2:28:56
certificate signed by Amazon for this domain
2:29:01
for for one year something. And the detail is this one. It's only for this one. And this is a public key set valid.
2:29:08
So I get this public key. My browser used to share my symmetric key. And we do all the configuration very much
2:29:14
secure. Okay. And why sec why this validated validate? Because two reason.
2:29:21
One reason is this domain name what you're connecting is matching to the
2:29:26
issuer name. Second thing this isue by Amazon. By my browser know about Amazon.
2:29:31
See. So they know about the signature of Amazon because Amazon work. So there's
2:29:37
two reason or maybe some small reason is also valid. So there are multiple thing why they have to be valid. So guys like
2:29:42
long discussion actually um uh if you go to some advanced security classes of uh
2:29:48
AWS uh there they have this entire chapter on this topic but I cover all
2:29:53
everything whatever they had there. Okay. So it is again a part of certificate. Now this is the example of
2:30:00
public key private key symmetric behind this in the usual. Okay. So that's all guys for my side today lots of things we
2:30:07
had discussed if if you practice one or two times you can see uh you know guys
2:30:12
now this thing is so simple I I know long back everything we have to do it
2:30:18
manually we have to create RCA we have to create a CA change
2:30:23
CRT sign it lots of commands in L server I have to done manually very much
2:30:28
painful I remember right uh even though redhead has their own program that's
2:30:33
called triple3 free purely based on this topic. Okay, long back, right? So, it
2:30:39
was very harder but we have to do it manually but now because of these kind of services one click everything has
2:30:46
been has been clicked or done. Okay. So, um that's all guys uh from my side. Any
2:30:54
queries if you have you can ask me ask me
2:31:04
yes uh Rahul ML project summer is a very different level right uh nobody can uh
2:31:10
beat the the the content or the project that we are going to develop in this
2:31:16
summer 2021 about envelopes even though guys I highly recommend this workshop
2:31:21
also I told you yesterday also uh Because all the AI services we are going
2:31:26
to discuss in this workshop.
2:31:46
So uh any questions over here? uh SS no plan zagar for uh cyber security
2:31:54
workshop I used to take uh long back but normally it is normally misused the
2:32:00
content knowledge is misused in the market right so I stopped taking cyber security or hacking classes
2:32:21
So how we provide a public key in CSR? Actually uh I use right now in cloud
2:32:28
everything is automated but if you create a CSR CSR guys automatic create
2:32:35
normally public key or if you have in the command line they can pass in which file you have the public key. So
2:32:41
whatever tool you use for example open SSL is a very much
2:32:47
useful tool. So in the command line they have option to ask you where is your public key while you're creating a CSR.
2:33:07
So guys very interesting concept uh this is uh to to have a complete setup in the
2:33:14
terms of security. Okay.
2:33:23
Uh yes, P you can somehow say uh secret manager is a password manager. Password
2:33:30
manager normally in our OS we have or in app we
2:33:35
have to manage the password norm manager is normally is app also in
2:33:41
some kind of software that will do all the things but secret manager is not software it's just putting the data
2:33:46
there my developer has to create some app or on the top of this but yeah
2:33:52
somehow you can say secret manager is like a password manager but not only password any credential you
2:33:58
can put There any sensitive data you can put there.
2:34:21
So
2:34:27
uh I'm just trying to figure out this CAS means under ACM is free. Uh yes ACM is
2:34:35
service is free. So if you create any certificate right now today I create one or two certificate. So creating a
2:34:40
certificate or sign by Amazon it is free. So whatever you using in ACM it is
2:34:46
free. That's what I'm talking about.
2:35:01
how guys yes so subhas is a very great question actually you ask so he asked you how to redact http to https so guys
2:35:07
there are a lot of way uh one way is you can put in your application like in web server anybody can come come on http
2:35:14
they redact to https or you can put your code also okay or normally in Load
2:35:19
balancer we have a you know in the load balancer we have a rule of routing
2:35:25
policies by in this load balancer we don't have okay but if you go to other load b
2:35:31
application load balancer we have created a path policy something so there we can
2:35:37
set a rule anybody come on port redact to uh 443 okay so multiple way in the web server
2:35:43
you can write in your PHP code you can write or in load balancer in some of the load balancer we options to say. So if
2:35:50
anybody come to HTTP react to HTTPS this is a very commonly way you set up we
2:35:55
always use
2:36:10
so um let me
2:36:18
How can decrypt the key in deep learning by making perform? No actually so it's
2:36:24
not about model or deep learning. Uh decryption need a key right? Decryption
2:36:30
need a key. So whatever method you use maybe AI
2:36:38
machine learning it won't work.
2:36:51
Uh somebody say but a website got hacked yet. Actually wer test
2:36:57
one part of security won't help you to manage other part of security. If you
2:37:02
put everything in HTTPS but if you bug in a PHP code if you remove the bug in the PHP code but if you bug in in in
2:37:10
your uh databases. Okay. So tons of thing is there or everything is foolproof. So somebody has might have do
2:37:17
some kind of uh reverse engineering or maybe social engineering or social text
2:37:22
you know some SMS come in mobile phone they call they give you some offer you know something there's hundreds of thing
2:37:29
guys uh to to be considered in the security world. So something is break it
2:37:34
means some other security has a flow or maybe your social attack somebody's doing.
2:37:42
So it's not a small thing hundreds of things we have to take care.
2:37:52
So so that's all uh guys uh there will be a
2:37:57
lot of query but I think if you practice this it will be covered. So we'll see you guys in next talk, next class some
2:38:04
more new uh concept we going to discuss. Okay, I take you guys. Good day.
2:38:09
Perfect.
