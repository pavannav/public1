ript


3:55
So uh uh welcome guys and let's continue with the next part.
4:01
So lots of uh core uh concept uh in in
4:06
somehow in very detail uh we was uh discussing about Kubernetes.
4:12
Uh but uh my plan is to take a very different topic. uh today it is
4:17
obviously with related to Kubernetes but um in the real world uh if you want to
4:25
uh you know use Kubernetes platform now it is your choice in your on premises
4:32
data center um managed by your own virtual machines uh or you want to use
4:38
some services uh of Kubernetes from the public cloud or maybe from the private cloud okay uh
4:47
We use Kubernetes to to deploy our our application but uh because our
4:55
environment is sometime very big or uh sometime very complex u I'm talking more
5:02
about uh uh application deployment perspective okay so you know
5:10
implementing uh and uh launching resources one by one it will be very uh
5:17
much tedious task uh most of the time. What I mean by this, I will explain you again from very zero. Uh but so
5:24
technically in in the real world, if you want to uh implement any resource of the
5:30
Kubernetes for your entire application, we need some kind of package manager. Okay. So u so normally uh 99% we always
5:41
use a package manager of the kubernetes and this is the way we always deploy the
5:49
app or the resources in the kubernetes cluster. So kubernetes has their own
5:54
package manager okay or I can say there's one third party package manager that is used for the kubernetes. So name
6:02
of that program in the to the tool is called Helm. So guys today's the entire
6:08
class would be on Helm. Okay. And the package in this cuber world is known as
6:14
chart. So uh our class will be a little bit more advanced. Today we'll start from
6:20
very basics very interesting topic this is. But today I will show you also how
6:26
to create your own personal chart because a lot of package and chart available in the market in public
6:31
market. Uh but uh obviously if you have your own custom you know application you
6:37
have you should know how to create your own uh personal chart. So the entire
6:43
class would be on helm on chart and plus how to create your own uh chart. So that
6:49
is the agenda guys for today.
6:54
Okay. Uh but let me first start with very zero uh what exactly uh the package
7:01
manager is and what kind of challenge you will face and why we need the package manager from here. Let me start.
7:09
Uh but uh but guys for today's demo I again going to use the same uh cubernetes cluster uh the cluster that I
7:16
we have created yesterday and that has a total four node. One is master, three is
7:22
the worker node and the cluster was very uh working very fine. So I'm connecting
7:27
to my master node but technically in the Kubernetes world if you want to deploy
7:33
any resources resources means boot deployment replication controller and set right these are the resources. So
7:40
normally we have to work from uh our from our uh user computer. Okay. So to
7:47
to save our time I can make my windows as my user computer but see to save my
7:53
time by default normally your master node is a user computer. So I'm running everything from the master. Normally we
7:59
don't do and manage the cluster from the master. So right right now what I'm command all the command that I'm going
8:06
to write over here just think uh I'm running this command from my workstation
8:12
means let's say from my windows right. Okay. So there's the first command. This
8:18
command say we have a cluster ready and uh we have one master and three node.
8:24
Even though I can go for cluster info and this cluster info say our kubernetes
8:31
control plane is running here means this API server. If you connect to this API
8:36
and this port number right you will connect to the uh entire control plane
8:41
means all other component of the cubernetes. Okay. So basic command nothing special
8:47
here right but till date guys uh let's say let's talk about one uh small use
8:52
case till date again again I want to tell you one more time this is a topic helm we
9:00
are talking about by chance uh we are into the program of CKA and mostly guys
9:06
are also doing CK a so none of the program uh has helm or chart in the
9:13
program in the agenda I'm taking this class as extra class uh
9:19
because a lot of guys keep on asking me to take this extra topic because it's very important topic very much useful this is the way we deploy the thing in
9:26
the kubernetes so as a kubernetes engineer you should know about helman chart and plus you should know how to
9:32
create your own customiz chart so this is extra class for you but for me and
9:37
for my recommendation this is very important part in the cubernetes world okay you should know and everybody
9:42
should know very detail about helm and the chart. Okay. So, let me start from
9:48
here. Sorry. What helm and uh what is chart?
9:54
So, uh yeah, guys, before uh I'll start this topic, I have a very quick uh announcement for you. I'm very excited
10:00
uh for this announcement also. Let me I just need 20 10 minutes from you. Uh let
10:06
me quickly announce and then we'll come back uh to this topic. The announcement
10:11
is something like this. Um u maybe guys till date uh maybe you have seen
10:18
multiple use case also in the market and you come to know um the world or every
10:26
company has their own application and for launching the application they now the application they put in the
10:32
containerized world and Kubernetes is one of the platform or cluster where
10:37
almost all the company deploy the application. So this is the very common trend in the market and this tool is
10:44
very much popular from last couple of years uh where we deploy everything and
10:49
you guys know maybe the now the power of Kubernetes. Okay. But from last couple of month or
10:56
last this few year especially last two years I have seen a a huge shift. Okay.
11:04
The way we use the cubis cluster because uh working in the cubis cluster maybe
11:10
look like sometime those who know uh this uh tool very much in detail maybe
11:16
simple but this tool have some more uh you know in in deploying the app we need
11:23
some more facility that is not the the core of the cuber so technique cuber
11:30
doesn't provide for example if you want to create a entire pipeline from end to Right. So for this um Kubernetes is not
11:39
alone will do this thing for you. You need some tool like genkins to integrate
11:44
with Kubernetes for entire CI/CD pipeline. Okay. Or maybe creating your
11:50
own private repository or moning tool or management tool or so a lot of thing is there that we need
12:00
to managing or launching the app. Okay. So that is the reason
12:06
some tool or application or platform available in the market that that run on the top of kubernet kubernetes so
12:12
powerful we don't want to change this but there's some kind of tool or the management tool I I say that's work on
12:18
the top of kubernetes and uh and this tool makes kubernetes so simple and plus
12:24
lot of extra features they add on the top of kubernetes that normally solve the use case of the industry that
12:31
kubernetes never provide to you because it is not the core of the Kubernetes. Okay. So the tool that I'm talking about
12:37
is open sift and I've seen it is a tool from red hat
12:42
red hat and I've seen a huge sudden shift or migration or certain
12:48
demand in the market uh for uh for the open shift and even though in the
12:54
fresher world also because normally in this kind of tool normally company uh pick the the the
13:02
experienced guys but because there's a huge demand come up and maybe most probably there might be lot of not lot
13:08
of uh uh resources or trained people available in the market. So I've seen a
13:14
lot of fresher also guys uh redhead pick or their client pick for the open recently around eight intern from blanx
13:24
world has been uh been is ready acquired these guys as an
13:30
intern most of guys in open shift world so there would be more example right so
13:36
what I'm talking about because you guys are doing a great in kubernetes but uh I
13:43
I I suggest or I recommend uh recommend
13:48
uh to enhance your skill uh you have a you
13:54
should have a great uh knowledge in open. Okay. And because of this right also guys initially launch one training
14:02
program right uh so that anybody can very quickly start on the cubernetes
14:08
world uh with the open sift and the openive integration with kubernetes something like this. So so they launch
14:13
one program called do 180 where they talk a lot of thing about kubernetes
14:19
mainly they talk about open shift and main many features of the open shift. They if you see here if you search for
14:27
do 180 is the one official program uh from redhead container and the
14:33
kubernetes okay but technically this is the entire really based on the open so
14:40
so my recommendation guys here is whenever in the future uh you've got a time
14:46
right and a chance uh so definitely uh start your journey of open sift
14:54
from this program is officer program from redhead. This is one thing even
14:59
though I also suggest after this uh training program they have one more uh global examination associated with this
15:05
is called ex 180 this exam with this and
15:11
after this program you can go for uh the global exam of of this guy. So for the
15:16
cubernetes guys and because you guys are kubernetes I I highly recommend this. But why I'm announcing this right now?
15:23
There's even reason for this because guys this is a redhead authorized program and the normally this kind of
15:31
advanced program of the redhead they come with a very huge price. So if you see guys 40,000 plus in Indian currency
15:38
is just a training price from redhead and after this uh program if you go for
15:44
examination so exam price is uh 16,000 so around 50 55,000 in Indian
15:51
currency they they charge you okay but so why am I announcing today because
15:57
recently okay uh because of some have some requirement come up or because of the
16:03
covid I don't know part of the reason would be uh Reddit has come up with one
16:09
great offer and because we are the partner of Reddit. So I'm just sharing this information to you and you can take
16:15
a take a call if you want to go for this global program and the examiners right
16:20
so the training from redhead and exam from red hating is around 40,000 rupees
16:27
exam is around 16,000 rupees so whatever the price would be so red right now because of some reason they're offering
16:34
this entire bundle in 28,000 uh Indian currency so in 28,000 entire training
16:41
come up entire exam also come up and one more great thing is they're also giving a second attempt free in the examination
16:47
they're also giving this one and because of this lockdown or everything is online
16:53
uh they have one more protocol role where they charge some extra bulks for
16:59
the role while the role they have the own labs on the redhead cloud and uh so
17:05
they are offering this entire lab plus they have some video classes from the redhead us instructor
17:13
Okay. Plus they have some some some online documents and books all the things. So this also guys they're
17:19
providing free with this one. So 28,000
17:24
training exam second attempt and uh the entire VC or role whatever they say with
17:31
labs and all the things they are providing. So anybody who wanted to go for this uh
17:38
they can uh they can uh plan for this uh this uh this particular exam and in this
17:44
training. Okay. But this is guys this is the uh this is the official announcement
17:50
uh from the uh red hat. anybody from anywhere from India. It is guys by this announcement uh is for only for Indians
17:58
because a lot of guys over here may be from uh different country over here. This this price is is
18:06
for India. So if you have from other country you have to check your price at
18:11
your uh country. Okay, this price is for India. This is one thing but uh this is
18:18
not the exciting thing for me. Okay, exciting thing is is a different right. This is the offer from Red Hat. The
18:24
exciting thing is okay uh that uh we as a Linux world we always take a cool
18:31
whatever we think the the technology that is very important for us exam is very important for grooming uh the
18:37
students or grooming uh some of our participants here. So what we did guys
18:43
uh this is official for public guys anybody who want to join publicly they can join with this prize but anybody
18:49
over here who are the Linux world student in this kubernetes batch
18:55
okay in this kubernet batch right I want you guys go for this uh this training and
19:02
examinion is very much helpful so with some kind of agreement with red hat and
19:08
some kind of intent discussion with redhead for you guys. We uh got a extra
19:15
benefit offer. Uh so everybody over here in the criminal batch uh the the the
19:20
final edit approved and we as also take some contribution formalized world uh
19:26
you have to only uh give a charge of I think 12,500 rupees something like this
19:31
12.5k okay so in 12.5k entire training global exam second attempt VC labs online labs
19:39
we see recorded classes books and everything with some days I don't know 6 80 hours or 80 days 90 days something uh
19:46
we they'll bid you the exact number and time uh they offer to you. So this is one thing. So anybody over here in the
19:52
kubernetes class it is only for this batch only for kubernetes no other batch I have keep on delivering multiple
19:58
batches also like enable or AWS it is only for uh this batch for some reason
20:05
because you guys would be the right resource for the open s because the intention is to create a great resource
20:12
for the open source guys so that customer of red can consume you wherever
20:17
they want to consume in their project or maybe in the job. This is one thing one more important announcement and that is
20:24
that I am very much excited for uh because a lot of guys here are the part
20:30
of my earth program and earth program guys we launched for some great course
20:37
and those guy who were there they know uh what exactly we are doing there okay
20:43
um so for this kubernet come down and we also have contributed from something
20:49
from our side but for the earth guys uh from the Lennis world uh you can say
20:54
pocket okay we are you can think as a sponsor right
21:00
we are doing from u the Linux world side and anybody and everybody here from the
21:06
earth okay you don't have to pay this much it is for other guys that are not the part of earth in the kubernetes
21:12
class and for earth it is just for 8.5k all right entire feature just for 84.5K.
21:21
So you can think Reddit never come down to this price is a is a insane price you can say. Uh it
21:29
it it is so low because uh for the earth guys Linux world is uh is sponsoring uh
21:37
some a big amount. Okay, one more last information. Anybody who are from earth
21:43
and by chance they are already started the journey of the red hand certification. For example, a lot of
21:48
guys over here are also done or doing 294 examination. They already enrolled
21:54
and they are going for this examination. Right. So anybody who are in this combination
21:59
okay so we get some extra benefit from dinosaur and from deadhead and uh and
22:05
the price is 6.5k. Right. So, believe me guys in the red world I I
22:12
never uh see this actually red never come down to that price. I suggest just
22:18
go and see the market. They have some more partners in uh in in market in
22:23
multiple cities. Uh you come to know what kind of content and price they they charge means Reddit charge actually by
22:30
through partner. Okay. But especially this price
22:35
for both the guys, Linux World is is purely sponsoring the
22:41
so I highly recommend okay because I want you guys to be certified in in uh
22:47
in DO 180 they have a great value in the
22:52
perspective of uh the career and the future. So highly suggest especially for the earth guys to do it and anybody who
22:59
are not from the earth by joining the kubernetes they might have to pay this much again but that is so much pure
23:05
sponsored by red hat you can think they can also should have to go for this
23:11
thing but what is coming there is very quickly training come up exam come up second attempt come up all the things
23:16
lab VC and whatever they have they come up one more small information I just want to tell you recently they've done
23:21
this you guys might know the process so they have a RSCSA exam examination then RSC and the most advanced examination on
23:28
redhead is called RSCA there's the most advanced examination uh
23:34
this called architect okay and if you pass five specialized paper in red hat
23:39
then you become RCE you can get this title and the great thing is recently guys they added uh DO
23:46
180 as a part of RSCA so if you do this training and if you pass this examination that
23:52
you you will definitely pass um So you will get one level up in the RSC at
23:59
least one part you will do. So you'll have extra certificate for D1
24:05
but you will also get one uh part from RSCO. So this is recently guys they have
24:11
added even though maybe somewhere they might have they count toward RSC.
24:17
Okay. And one more small thing that I I always believe. Okay. If you search for
24:23
redhead professional, there's a link and there they put all the certified guys uh in the Red Hat
24:31
world. If you uh go for this link, I think maybe this link. Okay. And if you search
24:37
for the total uh guy who till date certified
24:43
in this uh uh in this exam. So the program name is specialized in container
24:49
and kubernetes. This is a global surfing list. I'm just searching for India. You
24:54
guys can see your country name also there. If I search and what you find
25:00
guys, what do you find here? Okay. U
25:06
light capture. uh you'll find uh the value of the
25:13
certificate value guys mostly because we have a huge demand
25:19
and we have very limited resource available and this is one of the way we can verify because till now in India we
25:25
have total nine guy who is certified right or mostly most of the guys are
25:32
from uh the uh Reddit only so they are the already employed by red so from outside very limited guys by since I'm
25:39
Okay. So is there who certified this one? So technically after you give this
25:46
exam you would be the top 10 top 50 guy in India who will be certified. So having this title of top 10 top 50 is
25:53
always give a vet and the guy who will always you know first one in the in this kind
25:59
of world always get extra benefit before everybody go in this line. the better we
26:06
have to enhance our skills and our platform. Okay. So uh so this was guys
26:13
the quick uh announcement I have very excited um because uh excited because u
26:19
we are doing something great for the community. So that is the reason uh why I'm excited over here to announce this
26:27
otherwise normally I don't announce for any of the training and examination normally. Okay. So highly suggest we
26:34
will uh my team will provide you the same details in your respective WhatsApp group. Okay. Any further queries if you
26:40
have you can ask uh to uh the team.
26:45
Okay. Um uh u you ask your team and u u
26:52
um u one minute and uh yeah one more thing uh because
26:59
this is there's also content training uh bison yeah one more thing I forgot to tell you because they have a
27:05
pre-recorded uh video classes from a Reddit instructor but I also take a call
27:11
uh uh that is uh I also take this training um online the way I'm doing Kubernetes right
27:16
So you can go for recorded classes but I I I want to deliver this training by for
27:22
by myself so you can get some extra also knowledge uh the way it has been used
27:29
open shift in the market. Okay. Okay. So this training would be online. Uh till
27:34
now we haven't planned uh schedule but most probably we go for weekend. So
27:40
maybe Saturday and Sunday we might go for otherwise the exact schedule of this training we guys update you when we do.
27:48
Okay. And again this is the only batch because this is online training by me and mostly I when I take the training I
27:54
always do a training only once mostly. Okay. This is the only batch. This is the only tank and uh and I suggest
28:02
anybody who want to go for global one plus this kind of track uh highly recommend it just just plan for this
28:10
okay and anybody have agreed plan by because I'm discussing right now for RSCA
28:17
so this is the one more uh link where you can verify all the uh
28:25
certified guys okay so this link this This is my uh uh certification ID. Uh why I'm saying
28:32
nothing special actually just because we are talking about RSCA. Uh so maybe you
28:38
will also have this link after you pass you will uh have your own certified ID
28:43
from the redhead and your your company will put your ID and they can and after
28:49
they verify they come to know uh that you have certified in this kind of certification. So this is the my list of
28:55
certification that I done in one of the track in red hat is a is never ending
29:01
list. So almost everything I have done in red and by chance you guys might know
29:06
I am the first one and the only one who is RSC level 23. This is the topmost
29:13
level in the redhead world that is possible. Even though there's one more RSC actually is is developer track. Uh
29:21
we haven't maybe I haven't discussed till date. Okay, this called RH AEA.
29:26
This is the RHCA in the developer track and I am in the ninth level. Again, this is the top one in the world. Okay. And
29:33
this I am the only one in the world who has this combination both the side 23 level and n level in this area and this
29:40
is one of the top level uh in this world right but yeah you after you certified
29:46
your name also come up here you put your ID what provided by redhead and your name will come that you passed in this
29:52
one and this is very new certificate even though if you see I recently passed this exam so this very because whenever
29:59
new exam come up I always try to be the first one in the world. So maybe this
30:04
around this time this exam come up and I given this exam. So very recent exam very new and has a huge value.
30:12
Okay. So that's a quick announcement uh guys uh from my uh side and highly
30:20
suggest my team will give the further information. Okay let's continue with the today's
30:26
topic. Okay and I just want to tell you one more time. Okay, this all the
30:32
announcement that I'm doing here only for the cubernetes batch only for you guys. Okay, anybody from any other
30:38
batches of mine or anybody from publicly you guys might know they wanted to go for this training uh we can't go for
30:47
this one they have to go for public price that is given by Reddit. So why I'm saying this because this this is the
30:54
official norm uh uh ready asked me to announce. So there will be no
31:00
uh uh challenge in the in the the you know in the managing the fee structure
31:06
by other partners. Right. Okay. So public price anybody who want to do publicly they can do with same content
31:13
same offer but they have to go for this price. Anybody from your link they want to also attend they can also go. Okay.
31:22
Okay. So, let's continue guys with the help. Okay. So, let me explain you what
31:27
is the use case uh we have. So, guys, if you notice till uh till date,
31:34
okay, whatever guys you have done in the Kubernetes. Okay. Final moto is final
31:40
moto is is to launch the app. For launching the app, what we normally
31:46
do, we launch a deployment. This is the one thing we always do
31:52
and obviously how you know how we do we use cubectl command create deployment it
31:57
will deploy the ports. Second thing what we do um deployment doesn't uh help you
32:04
to expose the service. So we have to also create a service also with a type node type and node port or maybe load
32:10
balancer. Maybe some of the port might require secret database. Some of the
32:16
port uh deployment might require PVC. Okay. Some of the port might require
32:22
conflict map that we will discuss in the future. Some of the port might require uh roles and role binding.
32:28
Okay. So to launching one single app or I can say one of the component in one of
32:33
the name space. Okay. We have to uh
32:38
create these resources. Okay. And after creating with the resources, you have to also sometime
32:44
configure these resources. For example, maybe after I or while launching the
32:49
service, I have to decide which node port I would like to run my service or
32:54
while launching a deployment or after a deployment I might have to decide which
33:00
how many replica I need. Okay, as if you remember in the deployment I talk about the strategy. So maybe after deployment
33:07
you launch a image with 1 version one. Maybe in the future you want to change the version two
33:14
or maybe you deploy this all the resources uh right now and maybe you are
33:20
the developer. So we have one more environment in the company. We have one more team let's say testing team. So
33:27
they also want to do same thing again with the same steps. Okay. So they have
33:32
to also run these commands again again with the same step. Some of the things they they missed the way we have been
33:39
created. Okay. So the way we have created some of the thing they missed they won't
33:45
get the same environment here but it means they have to memorize they have to see our document and run the same steps
33:54
but maybe there more there might be possibility in my case I use version two or they want to deploy version one. So
34:00
maybe in the deployment or the maybe in my vime file they go inside change the
34:06
version of the image but there might be possibility they don't know about so much of yl file and you guys know web
34:11
file is sometime messy if you give some extra space indentation is to come up so very hard to tr so technically what I'm
34:18
talking about finally right the final moto is the final moto is we have to
34:24
deploy the app for deploying the app we have to run write lots of command A lot
34:30
of resources we have to run here.
34:36
But if you want to create a a way all right where one click the entire
34:42
resources launch for this app. So what can we do? We can pack all these
34:47
resources in one package. One package. And let's say we give the
34:52
package name let's call my app. So in the future if you want to again
34:58
deploy the app rather than you run deployment SVC secret PVC one by one by
35:03
one all the respective YML file or maybe the command and you guys also know not for everything we have a command
35:09
available but for example you want to launch PVC we don't have a command right you have to create a YL file okay so you
35:15
don't have to write the command or run the VML file just click in this package
35:21
just double click you can something like this and entire package launch for Means entire
35:27
resources launch for you the way you plan. You want this one then this one then this one or the one more benefit we
35:34
have for this right so I can provide this package to my testing team
35:40
and say if you want to also want to test this guy okay or this this application
35:46
so this is the steps we have planned so I'm giving rather than my commands my vl file I am giving my package to you just
35:52
click on the package and entire setup will be launched in your environment also so whatever testing you want to do
35:58
on the top of this you can do it. So technically this is also way to make the thing very much standardized. So
36:05
multiple team in your in your organization they also want to launch the app the way it has been planned and
36:11
designed. Uh we can create a package it's like a you know it's kind of archive it's kind of tar we can share to
36:18
other team of testing or maybe other teams right who working with you they also double click and have the same
36:25
environment uh come up. So having the package has a lot of benefit a special
36:30
benefit is the standardization. So we can very simply uh create a standard iss
36:36
but one more benefit you can achieve here while creating a package we can do one more interesting thing here right we
36:42
can tell maybe we know we need a service we need a CPU we need a PVC okay but
36:48
while launching a deployment right now I'm deploying version two but maybe my test testing team want to launch version
36:54
one so we can create a package with some kind of uh flexibility okay So while
37:02
this uh this guy launch this package while launching the package they will prompt I will launch everything for you
37:08
but which version you want to launch. So my testing deal will put v_sub1 or v_sub2 enter right and whatever version
37:16
they put dynamically my package update they get this version and that version deployment will launch. So guys this
37:22
concept is called parameterized right or anybody who know language in the function we have parameter something
37:27
like this. So we can also make the package parameterized. Okay, parameterized. Uh so depend what
37:35
what you want to set the parameter. So do you want anybody who launch the par
37:41
uh launch your package they can change your version on the fly? They can change
37:46
the port number of your node on the fly. They can change the size of your volume
37:52
on the fly. So these there we can create a parameter. So anybody on any team who
37:58
want to use this package okay while launching the package uh they can decide on the fly that I want port
38:05
number 81 I want my my PVC size or 30GB. So my environment will launch with this
38:12
parameter. So we can also create a package with with uh with some variable here it is called parameter or
38:18
parameterized. Okay. So this is the guys very common uh scenario because it is only one it's not
38:25
only about one app right because you guys know multiple uh component or multiple deployment or multiple app
38:33
okay if you launch together then it become a one big big app or one multi-ter application okay for example
38:40
again you guys know we take one example already let's say WordPress application so if you want to launch WordPress
38:46
application then we need two deployment two services two CK two PVC Okay, one for front end, one for back
38:52
end, right? WordPress also need means my PHP also need uh storage, my database
38:59
also need a storage. My my PHP has their own port, WordPress has their own port.
39:05
Okay, if you only launch WordPress means PHP, if you don't launch MySQL database,
39:11
your application won't run. Okay, so technically there is a little bit bigger
39:16
application. So we can also create one single package for this and we say just one click entire package will install
39:24
means all the port for PHP all the port for MySQL all the PBCC whatever they
39:30
have they need one click everything is stored and finally my application will deploy. So we have we have single tier
39:36
application multi-ter microservices they have lots and lots of component and everybody connect to each other. So we
39:43
put everything entire one application in one box that's called package one click
39:49
it will it will execute or deploy for us and that for for this we have to create
39:54
a package okay and guys this is the same concept we use almost in every operating system
40:02
so anybody who know about fajaba red hat so in the red if you want to
40:08
uh you know have and install some software okay So software guys what software will
40:13
do software will give some softwares binaries document some icons. So that is
40:20
reason guys we always use the word package. So either you can use the word package or software sync.
40:27
So all the files we put in one box called package. Okay. But for every OS
40:33
if you want to install the software and the package they have their own package manager.
40:40
Duty of package manager is to install the package, update the package, remove the package or maybe there might
40:46
possibility one package or one software depend on other package. For example, anybody who know Redhead, there's a
40:52
software called HTTP. If you want to install this software package, this software say I am dependent on three
40:58
more software. You have to install these three software first then you can install me. That's called dependency.
41:04
So there might be possibility. Same thing here. If you want to install uh for example PHP WordPress uh package
41:13
they say I can't install right if you want to install me you have to first install a package for MySQL. So I'm
41:19
depend on this. So if package is great thing one click entire service done but
41:24
we also need package manager who will manage the thing they will uninstall they upgrade if new version come up they
41:31
delete they they manage the dependencies multiple thing they can do for but for this we need some manager who manage my
41:38
package those called package manager for example in redhead the package manager is known yum or nowadays a new one is
41:44
called dnf anybody from yubuntu we have a ad get command anybody from Mac, we
41:50
have homebrew. All right. From Windows, Chocolatey, anybody from Python, we have paper. So, language to language, OS to
41:59
OS, everybody has their own package manager. They have similarly in the
42:05
Kubernetes world, they also come with a package manager. So, if you want to manage the package, in the Kubernetes
42:12
world, the name of the package manager is Helm. So, Helm is the name of the uh
42:19
package manager. It is not from the Kubernetes as a third party tool but is mainly meant for managing it's open
42:26
source but it's mainly meant for managing Kubernetes packages. And one more thing guys normally in the OS world
42:34
we use a term called software. Sometime we also use a word called package but in the Kubernetes world package is actually
42:41
known as chart. So here guys in the today's class if I use the term package I normally mean to
42:49
say chart right. So here the terminology is chart. So technically in the kubernetes we put all the resource in
42:56
one box and that box is called package means that is called chart. And how to install the chart? We can use
43:03
helm uh to uh to install the chart. What is help me is one kind of tool or one kind of software that help me uh that
43:10
help me to install uh the chart. Okay.
43:15
So now point over here is okay from where you get the package or the
43:21
software. So there's two way means I'm talking about chart from where you get the chart. Let me use the word package
43:27
also here. Okay. So there's two way either you can go to internet and there's lot of uh uh websites or I can
43:36
say a better word would be repositories where you can find lot of packages and charts available. So a lot of third
43:42
party guys uh commentaries guys has created the chart. So you can find the chart for WordPress, you can find the
43:48
chart for Jumla, take PHP uh databases, Jenkins. So almost all the main product
43:55
available in the market where you think uh where where normally we deploy those
44:01
app in the top of Q. So some of the community member has created a package and chart for us. We can directly go
44:08
there download that package and chart and double click and we can store. So there are a lot of public reposity is
44:15
also known as hub for the chart available. just download from there you can store it or other would other way
44:22
would be we can create our own custom chart or own custom package and why need
44:27
of this because obviously let's say somebody has put some package for let's say uh Apache web server so they put
44:35
their commands they put their deployment file their services their secret but
44:40
maybe uh maybe in my company requirement I don't want to use let's say deployment
44:46
I want to use demonset Maybe there might be possibility I want that I don't want to use secret. I just
44:52
want to keep my data somewhere else. Okay. So I have my own custom requirement and this is a very common
44:57
thing. Uh mostly we always has our own custom requirement to launching our app.
45:04
Okay. Um so um for this you can create your own steps means own resources means
45:11
own package and chart that's called custom chart. Okay. So both the way guys
45:16
I'm going to show you today. First I will go for how to create your own custom chart so that you guys
45:21
comfortable with some vocabulary because you know how to create your own then I'll show you how to download from
45:26
somewhere from public hub and public repository and can also so both the things I'm going to uh show you but what
45:33
is use of chart and package and help I think I'm very clear and you guys now
45:38
may be comfortable with this terminology here okay so first topic for today is
45:45
first topic for today is how to create your own custom package
45:51
or means custom chart. Okay, so that's what we are going to do. But who are
45:57
going to manage the chart and package? Helm. So first of all guys, we have to install Helm. So in my case and one more
46:05
thing guys where you install the helm obviously you install the helm in your user computer means your work workspace.
46:12
So technically in my case my windows is workspace. You have to install here. But right now I'm making my master as my
46:18
user computer. So I'm doing everything in my master computer. Okay. So I'm installing helm over here. So this
46:25
computer don't have the helm command. So my first thing is how to install helm. Let me start from here.
46:32
So uh if you search for helm install something like this.
46:38
Okay. So there's a link installing help.
46:44
Okay. So this link I'm I'm sharing to you
46:51
one guys. So this link I'm sharing to you. go to this link and here they ask
46:59
tell you if you want to install the helm uh there's a multiple way all right you can install and even though if you have
47:07
a Mac you can use this command it will auto install the helm for you in windows you can run this command if you have
47:12
choco setup it will install for you and some other OS they have uh the other
47:18
command available okay but I'm just going for a general very basic way
47:24
normally it work in almost in all the OS Okay. So, I'm installing the helm uh
47:29
from the binary. So, they have the link over here. Okay.
47:34
I'm just uh I'm just clicking in this link. Okay. And they and they give you all the
47:41
version of the available and the software. You can download uh the Helm software from here. And one more thing
47:48
guys, I just want to uh make a note here uh just to update you guys. Okay. Helm
47:55
come with two version. Obviously the latest and now a stable version is
48:01
version three. But most of the time guys you might see version two.
48:06
Okay. But the working of version two and version three is very different. Okay. So normally what happened? Let's say
48:11
this is entire Kubernetes cluster. Okay. And this is my work station by my
48:19
user computer. So normally we have to install Helm program in our user. let's
48:24
say my windows but this Helm is a one kind of client program
48:30
okay and if you want Helm have a capability to connect to your Kubernetes
48:35
so that they can launch and install the package means they launch the entire resources mean like a deployment port
48:42
okay so in this kubernet cluster we have to run one program
48:47
that's called cyber program one server app and one server port we have to launch
48:54
So whenever hel want to install any package or chart they will contact to
48:59
this server program and the server program take the request and this program will contact to kubernetes and
49:05
ask one of my help program or my client want to uh launch this package means
49:10
this resource. So name of this program is called uh tiller t i l e r. So tiller
49:18
is one of the server side program in the helen. So this is this is the guys server client server model or server
49:25
client model. So guys helm work on the server client model till version two. So
49:31
if you have a helm version two you need one thriller program in your cubernetes
49:37
server. It is like a port you can launch a port for the thriller. Okay but right now we are using helm
49:43
version uh three and in hel version three guys this model architect has been
49:48
absolute. There's no subup program exists here. There's no thriller program
49:54
exist here. So in the version three only one Helm client has a capability to
50:00
directly contact to the cubernetes. So you can think helm is actually directly contact to the API program. So they
50:06
don't need any extra uh theor program. So right now we are using version latest
50:11
version helm version 3. So anybody who know a little bit about the so don't confuse with this term. This is a little
50:18
bit older way to do the things. Now tailor has been has been obsolute in
50:25
version three. Okay, that's what I would like to tell you here. And that is the reason guys until my version two we
50:31
normally use a command called helm in it. Okay, so this is a command uh we use
50:38
till version um very straightforward. Okay, very
50:45
straightforward. We just need this tool. No tiller required. Okay. So we are
50:51
going uh guys using the one of the latest version of Helm 3.5.2
50:57
and from this link you can download software for Windows or Mac. Right now I'm using Linux that is a version uh AMD
51:05
64 you know in my case in in your case normally this is the version we have
51:11
architecture we have. So I just do a right click copy the link and I'm also
51:16
guys sharing that this direct link to you. Okay. And I'm going to my Linux system and I use wget command to
51:23
download the software. So guys technically we downloaded a helm
51:29
software. Okay. And we have to install it because this is a archive file. So we have to untard this with this option.
51:38
Okay. So what this command will you know uncompress and unjip
51:44
okay this software okay and if you do ls you can see one folder
51:50
come up and inside this folder they come with some extra files this not important for us they come with a command called h
51:58
and guys normally in a linux we normally put the command in a folder called usr bin so what I'm doing here we have to
52:04
keep on using this command so this command I'm putting in usr bin or maybe in the bin folder. So that guys these
52:10
are the steps we are following. So it's a one time step you have to do and if you do so okay uh in your path helm
52:19
command come up now in your system you have a helm installed. So this is the way we can install the helm in our
52:25
workst. Same thing you can download for Windows. In Windows double click it will automatically install for you. Okay. So
52:32
I'm using in the Linux. Now Helm is installed one time setup we have to do
52:38
here. Now if I run the Helm last time which command was not there but if I try Helm now it come up. Even though if you
52:44
try to use the version of this command they are very clear. They say I'm using a version 3.5. So it's not two version.
52:52
So we don't have to go for th is just plug and play kind of command. Uh you can directly connect with the kubernetes
52:59
master and start working for us. So very straightforward nothing uh nothing else
53:04
we have to do here. Okay. Obviously one thing you tell to helm where is a cubern cluster running
53:11
and we know guys about the cube config file. cube config file is the one who
53:17
know about where is the cumul cluster running and what is the username password we have to use so in the helm
53:23
you can pass your cube config file uh if you have but right now in this computer
53:28
I don't need cube config file because I already have default file in my default locus so you guys know this location I
53:35
already discussed about okay so I already have my cube config file so
53:41
technically in this component I can run the helm directly Because helm biteful either use cube
53:49
config file or if you don't provide they will go to this folder and they find
53:54
where is the cubernetes cluster running they connect they log in and they start doing the thing so technically I don't have to do anything else here everything
54:00
is already configured technically I can directly use
54:06
so this is the step guys nothing is special all all the steps I shared with you is not at all important right but
54:12
what I only did here I installed Helm with the latest version called version 3. Okay. Now the main topic is not this
54:21
one. It's a pretty straightforward. Okay. The main part is how to create your own custom package means custom
54:27
chart. That's what guys I I I have to do right
54:33
now. Okay. And if you guys want to create a custom package or custom chart
54:39
uh it is something small kind of program we have to write. very small kind of program we have to write something like
54:44
this and guys whenever you write some extra extra program it's good practice to create a personal workspace to to put
54:52
uh this program so what I'm doing here in this camera I'm creating some extra workspace
54:59
and all the package that I'm going to create okay I'm going to put in this folder
55:06
okay and maybe my plan is to create lot of packages maybe for one web server for databases for genkins
55:13
depend guys what exactly you want to create a package for okay so that easy
55:18
reason guys I'm going to create one more folder here let's say my plan is to create a package for Apache web server
55:24
so I'm creating a folder called my web okay and so this is a folder and all the
55:31
anything that is related to Apache web server I'm going to put in this folder and and one more thing guys your folder
55:38
name is also equals to your package So what a package name you want to give
55:43
give the same folder name. So here my web would be the package name for me. So
55:51
if I want to share my package to other team I will share this folder. I will share this folder. Anybody who by
55:58
chance know anible it is something like a rule right? So I create I create a rule and role name is always like a a
56:06
folder name. Anybody who buys us know okay so right now just think okay this
56:13
is the folder or I can say this is equal to my chart or package or this package
56:18
name chart and in this chart what I'm going to put that will uh that will
56:24
install by the help okay but if you want more chart for example I want a chart
56:29
for let's say genkins I can get a folder for genkins if you want a chart for let's say for
56:36
MySQL database whatever name you want to give you can give here so folder name is equals to package
56:42
but right now I'm interested more in Apache web server so I will use this folder or use this package name okay so
56:50
what I'm doing here I'm just going inside this folder technically I'm here okay so this is a folder name or this is
56:57
a chart name but what this chart will do for you okay it will install a software for you okay for this you have to create
57:06
some configuration file for this chart.
57:11
And guys, config file name is always has a fixed name that's called chart
57:17
yl. This name is fixed is not yl is yl.
57:24
Okay. And c is in capital letter. So if you go to any of the folder or any
57:31
of the package if you say this is my package name or my chart name. So how
57:36
Helm know this is chart. So they will go inside this folder and look for this file and if they find this file they
57:42
consider this is the chart and the package for the kubernetes.
57:48
So this is the confusion file for the for the chart. Okay. And in this file
57:54
what you have to write there's some kind of keyword you have to write. one of the keyword uh is your name of your chart.
58:03
So obviously you have to give the same name the folder name is. So my folder name my web. So I'm giving my web here.
58:12
So this is the name of my uh chart. Okay. Here also guys we have to use some
58:17
API version. This API version is for chart. So I'm using V1 is a API version.
58:23
Okay. Plus this chart is going to uh is going to
58:29
um u do something for you means is a package. It will um install a package
58:36
for you mean chart for you that has multiple resources. So it is good practice guys whenever you create a
58:42
software we always give a version. For example if you talk about this software also helm is a software right and this
58:48
software has a version. If you go back you can see other version also there.
58:55
So why we create a version you guys know because when they have new version come up it means they come up with a new feature and they remove some bugs if
59:01
they have okay same thing we are doing here we are creating our own package so
59:08
my plan maybe in the future I keep on enhancing the this package and obviously after I enhance I will change the
59:15
version so right now I'm starting this package with a version called uh let's
59:20
say 0.1.0 Z or maybe 0.0.0 or 0.1 maybe whatever
59:26
number you want to use that would be your choice. So I'm just giving my package a version one and I after create
59:33
this package I share to my other team then I start doing some more thing in this package then I give change the
59:38
version two again share my team again change here three again share with other team or maybe I use so multiple versions
59:45
I am going to create for this software. Okay, they also mention guys app version also
59:52
here. Okay, so what application you are going to create? You are giving a version for this guy also. So what use of this app
59:59
version? We'll discuss in a minute. You can give any number maybe let's say this one. Okay. So it's not so many important
1:00:05
this part is very important. This two line is very important. So what is this use of this two line? I will explain you
1:00:12
in a minute. And also good practice guys to give a description about your package because sometime name
1:00:20
doesn't describe much. So I say this is my Apache server software or package and
1:00:26
chart. So what description you want to put here you can do it and some more thing you can uh you can put here
1:00:32
because this software you can share publicly also you can put your author name maintener name other information
1:00:38
you can support but these are some of the keyword that is a compulsory keyword that you have to put in the confile the
1:00:45
chart uh uh even though if you uh see the helm
1:00:51
helm chart yl file
1:00:57
variables. Okay. So if you if you go to this line uh this
1:01:03
file uh here they somewhere you might see okay which all the variable is
1:01:10
compile somewhere I I'll I'll share the link to you but technically these two or
1:01:16
three variables is very important you have to pass what use of this variables right now is
1:01:22
very harder to to understand but after I start deploying my Helm chart you will
1:01:30
can feel the use of uh these variables. Okay. So finally guys this is my pawn
1:01:37
file uh created. Okay. So technically this is my um
1:01:45
folder or I can say this a package name and why I'm saying this package because this folder contain this file. So any
1:01:51
folder contain this file then this folder will known as the package or this folder will known as the
1:01:59
known as the chart for the helm. Okay. So let's so you guys think in this way
1:02:04
in my computer in this folder we have created one chart. Okay. But we haven't
1:02:12
installed this chart yet. We have just created. So we ask helm do you know how
1:02:18
many uh package we have installed yet. So they say we haven't installed any
1:02:25
package yet or have any any chart yet. We have just created either you create
1:02:30
it or you download somewhere but we haven't installed yet. So help me say we don't have any
1:02:38
any uh software installed. But let's let me show you guys how to install. So I'm
1:02:43
asking my help that I want to install a software or package and that is in this
1:02:50
folder in this folder. So I want to install this software I told you guys folder is
1:02:56
equals to software name or chart name. So this is a way we can install. So anybody who know yum command you know
1:03:02
yum install. So this is like a yum install command or this is like a yum list command. Anybody who know about yum
1:03:07
command and when I run this it fail. They say you are going to install a software.
1:03:14
After install software, we give a software a name in my database. What name you want to give? So you can give
1:03:20
any name example my web name. Normally it's good practice obviously whatever
1:03:26
software folder name you create, you give the same name otherwise you can give whatever name you want. Okay. So
1:03:32
finally there's no error come up. A status is deployed.
1:03:38
Okay. Okay. And because we deployed or we installed only once right now. So the the usern is one because we deployed
1:03:44
only once. Okay. And if you see here we can see uh this software
1:03:52
has been deployed. Okay. And if you see guys here uh here uh if I make this uh
1:04:00
screen again here if you see here okay they deploy with a app version called
1:04:06
1.1. Okay. And they also have a chart version called uh my web 0.1. So from where this
1:04:16
uh name come from. Okay. So this name come from here. So
1:04:22
your name with version come here. So anybody who
1:04:27
can run the helm list command they can say which version of the package we have installed and they can also see which
1:04:35
app version means app also you can give the version whatever version you want to give you can see it's just a like a
1:04:40
metadata kind of thing but technically we have successfully created a chart of
1:04:46
package but right now this chart is doing nothing it's just a empty empty kind of chart right now this chart
1:04:52
is not doing anything what exactly we are asking to Okay. So moto chart is what the way I
1:04:58
try to explain you moto chart is to deploy some resource or deployment or port or services and something like
1:05:04
that. Right now the chart is not doing anything for me. Okay is is is nothing right is empty and how I know very
1:05:11
quickly because I know by chance cube shield command I can say do you have the have this guy deploy any code? No these
1:05:17
are the code that we deployed in my last class. Even though I certain things very clear. Let me delete all the things that
1:05:24
I created in my last class.
1:05:29
Okay. But you can see guys it is not if you see the age it is running from my last class. So this chart is not doing
1:05:36
anything because we haven't asked what to do. And from here the main part of the chart is start. So why we create a
1:05:43
chart? Why we create this folder? because anybody who install this folder
1:05:48
okay they launch uh resources for you in the Kubernetes we don't have to use
1:05:54
cubectl create command and we don't have to uh use a vl file apply and create
1:05:59
command they will as soon I run this
1:06:05
helm chart or it will deploy for me that's my plan is right now they haven't deployed anything because in my chart I
1:06:13
haven't put any resources Okay. So what I'm doing here, let me very quickly clean and clear my
1:06:18
environment of the helm. Okay. So let me delete because there's nothing. So let
1:06:24
me remove or I I think is delete. Delete my web. There's a name we have
1:06:30
given. Right. So in the future we can delete or we can update and enhance also. Okay. So I don't have any
1:06:37
installed in my local internal uh
1:06:42
repository. Okay. But I obviously I have uh this folder in my workspace.
1:06:48
Okay. Now what I'm doing here, let's uh start the main thing again from here. Okay. We have just created this folder
1:06:56
as a chart. And why this chart? Because they have the this internal metadata file or
1:07:03
against the configuration file. Okay. But why we create the chart? Because the moto is to put the resources. Okay. So
1:07:10
you guys if you want to put the resources so for the uh helm perspective
1:07:16
these resources are known as templates. Okay for example uh do you want to
1:07:21
install deployment do you want to throw services okay all these things all right for the
1:07:26
chart perspective these guys are known as templates and to managing template we have to create a folder called template.
1:07:35
So template folder we have to create and all the resources whatever we want to deploy we have to put here.
1:07:43
Okay. And we have to put all those resources in a YL format. Same viral
1:07:48
format that we discussed till date. So viral format YL file for port for
1:07:53
services for PVC the all the YL file that we create till date exactly same
1:07:59
file we have to copy here. Okay. either you I I go to my windows
1:08:04
system I can copy file here or we can also create a v file with cube shq command so I say can you please create a
1:08:11
deployment let's say with my okay and uh use a image let's say called
1:08:18
vimel 13in apache
1:08:23
web server hyper php with let's say v1 version I have there
1:08:30
okay but guys if you run this command You know it will deploy the port but I don't want this will deploy the port for
1:08:36
me. So I use dry and why I'm use dry it will create
1:08:41
deployment but they won't implement okay so that I can create a yl file from
1:08:46
this okay and whatever yl file they create it will print here and let me save this
1:08:54
file over here let's say this is deployment so this command we already used
1:09:02
okay so I I copy uh the file here Okay, so this is one of the command we might
1:09:07
use already used multiple time. So finally the moto is I need this file to
1:09:12
be here. But this command guys doesn't launch any port for you and that doesn't
1:09:18
launch any deployment for you. Okay, because I don't want to port to be launch deployment by ourself. I want
1:09:26
everything to be done by chart. Okay. But if you want to do with a chart, so inside your chart folder,
1:09:33
inside the template folder, this is the hierarchy they use. Copy this file,
1:09:39
copy this file. That's the only thing guys you have to do. That's all guys.
1:09:44
Now if if you talk about a chart perspective, so my chart name here is
1:09:52
my web. Okay. Now in this chart we add one
1:09:58
resource and by the resource name is deployment
1:10:04
how I add right it's pretty simple this file will be copy either you create this file with dry run or you know how to
1:10:10
create this your file by yourself or you might have other method also just copy
1:10:16
this file the way you know put here that's all guys this is a way you add
1:10:22
resources in this box But only one resource I add but we will add more
1:10:27
resources in it. Okay. But this has one resource. So now because uh this uh
1:10:34
chart has one resource. Now what I'm doing here I'm doing here. Now this time if I
1:10:40
launch this chart what happened? So again if you see I don't have a port running. I don't have any deployment
1:10:47
running. Okay. But now we don't require cubectl to launch any port in deployment. I can
1:10:54
ask helm helm will manage everything for me and I ask helm this is my chart
1:11:01
install this chart and give some name let's say my apache you can give any name give some name or maybe better
1:11:08
practice will be give the same name okay one click again this is the first time we are launching because I already
1:11:14
removed the last one again they deployed one time okay and by default they deploy
1:11:21
deploy in the name space called default You can change the name space. Okay. But this time if you see a helm list one we
1:11:30
have installed. Okay. But this time this chart contain one resource. So now guys
1:11:36
if I see the helm uh so cubectl get port command you can see port has been launched. See deployment also deployment
1:11:43
also been launched. But this deployment this port is not launched by ourself. our helm chart of
1:11:50
package has stored for us. Okay. So technically very quickly we have created
1:11:56
our own chart but inside the chart we have only deployment. If you see in the chart we
1:12:03
don't have any services. So none of the services launched by us. Okay. So in your chart you you know guys
1:12:12
after deployment we always always um launch a service also. So you
1:12:18
can add one more resource here. How I can I go to my chart file or chart folder or because you want to add more
1:12:26
resource you can go to templates and here can add one more file. So what service file you have you can copy here
1:12:33
or let me create a service file oursel. So you guys know we create a service file with expose keyword. I'm exposing a
1:12:40
deployment called Mid with a port called uh 80 with uh with type called node
1:12:48
port. Okay, I think n is capital and I'm dry
1:12:54
run because I don't want to run by myself. Oh, I want to create the template file. Okay, I'm just putting in
1:13:01
a file called service. So service is not at launch by us.
1:13:08
It's not launched by us but we created this file by this command or you can use
1:13:13
other way also. You guys know how to create this file. Okay. So this file has been created.
1:13:19
Okay. So anybody who run this file they will dep uh expose this uh deployment on
1:13:24
this port number. This part you know. Okay. But this file guys we create in this template folder and template is
1:13:31
part of this package. So it means it means this package
1:13:38
this package previously had one resource we have added one more resource.
1:13:44
It means if you install this package both the resource will deploy for us in one click entire resources or entire app
1:13:51
will be launched uh uh for us. Okay. But
1:13:56
understand something one more important thing here right uh this software is already installed in my case. So if you
1:14:04
see guys here hel list this software is already installed and
1:14:10
if you try to install this software again one more time they say it is already installed. So let me show you if I try to install this software again
1:14:17
and why I want to install one more time again because I add more resources. So I want to to launch both the resources.
1:14:26
Okay. But if I store again they say they already have. Okay. So technically if you want to
1:14:35
you know launch both the resources you have to install this but if you want to install this okay so there's two way
1:14:43
either first you delete this guy again launch. If you again launch both the thing will launch for you. But guys deleting sometime is not good right
1:14:50
because maybe you can think in this way maybe my developer who is creating this chart who's working on it they have done
1:14:56
something for us provided uh this thing to our team our team install this helm chart then my developer is still working
1:15:03
on it they add some more feature more resources they provide to us and after
1:15:09
they provide to us I don't want we to remove um what I had already so in
1:15:16
this case guys what we normally do we have to up update this thing. So we have
1:15:21
a way to update. Okay. Uh so uh so again what I'm
1:15:26
repeating guys here I already have a deployment but we don't have a service
1:15:33
but we know in my package service come up. So I can ask helm
1:15:38
that I want to upgrade my this chart.
1:15:45
That's what I I wanted to do. I want to upgrade this. Okay. Uh so uh let's see
1:15:53
how it work. Okay. So guys, if you want to upgrade, there's two argument uh they ask.
1:15:59
Okay. You have to give your chart name. Which chart you want to upgrade? So this is actually my chart name. So it is not
1:16:05
working. Upgrade is not working. They say can you tell me the release which release you want to upgrade?
1:16:14
Okay. So technically you know what exactly they asking if you want to
1:16:20
upgrade. Okay, I just want to know uh the new version of uh of of this chart.
1:16:28
Okay, so guys here the use of version come in play. Okay. So uh even though if
1:16:34
you see the help of this guy also. Okay.
1:16:40
So u so technically if you run this command
1:16:47
here they actually asking that this software is already installed.
1:16:52
Okay if you want to upgrade either delete and install that will be your choice but if you want without delete you want to update the feature you can
1:16:59
upgrade. Okay but if you want to upgrade because this software already installed
1:17:04
how we know this installed because we track the version. Okay. So now for this guys what we have
1:17:10
to do after you think you change something in your chart update your
1:17:15
chart file. Okay. And last time we know the version was one in the one version uh we had
1:17:22
only one resource maybe deployment we change something in the package. So after change because you know you change
1:17:28
so it is you have to do it manually it will change your let's say 0.2 which
1:17:33
means something we have changed. Okay, something we have changed in this package. Okay,
1:17:40
now if you uh if you try to upgrade, okay, upgrade this folder
1:17:47
my web. Now you can see u release my web has
1:17:54
been upgraded. Okay, the user called happy um helm helming. And now this time
1:18:01
you see version two come up. If you see the list again
1:18:06
okay same software region two means two time we have run this because second time we upgrade the same thing okay and
1:18:14
after upgrade the new chart version come up 0.2 to whatever we put there.
1:18:20
Okay, come up and what new thing I added in my chart. Maybe I change something in
1:18:25
my deployment file or maybe I add some more resources. In my case, I I put more resources. It means if you run the
1:18:31
cubectl get deploy, same thing is already there. But you see the SVC now
1:18:36
new service come up. See, this one I added come up with some kind of port number. That's called note port number.
1:18:44
Okay. So this what guys you keep on enh enhancing keep on adding the feature
1:18:50
uh adding the feature and keep on updating or maybe there might possibility maybe
1:18:56
in the future you thought uh that you want to deploy right uh your deployment
1:19:06
not for uh one single replica your plan actually to always launch uh for three
1:19:12
replica for example So update your CH file here because you change something in your chart right. So
1:19:20
just update your metadata also of your chart configuration file LSS3.
1:19:26
So whenever you ask upgrade command to upgrade they will upgrade with the new
1:19:31
version. Okay. And if you see guys here in cubectl
1:19:36
we have a one port running. Okay. Now you don't have to ask and run the cube command. You can ask uh helm
1:19:44
that I have already my chart with this name I want please go
1:19:50
to this folder read this file you will see new version come up if you see there's new version come up which means
1:19:56
something I changed most probably I changed just go and check what I changed and accordingly upgrade
1:20:03
my my package and third version come up if you ask helm to list now three
1:20:09
version come up and obviously in the third version I launched three ports. So you can see three port has been launched
1:20:15
by the deployment. Okay. So that's all we do right. And now
1:20:20
in the same way maybe maybe in your pack in your this
1:20:25
application require PVC maybe require secret maybe require storage class right
1:20:31
so everything you guys know multiple resources you know put all the resources
1:20:36
in the same way inside your template folder or maybe in the first go write
1:20:42
everything then create a package and provide to other team members or maybe initially you write something provide a
1:20:48
team member or use by yourself and keep on enhancing the way I'm doing here and keep on upgrading whatever the way you
1:20:54
want to. Okay. So now this package has been has been created. Okay. We can provide
1:21:02
uh this package uh to our team. How this is a folder? We can share this folder or we can uh we can create a archive of
1:21:10
this folder. Okay. But one more interesting thing I will tell you here is when you talk about helm. Okay. Now
1:21:16
uh this package guys we upgrade two times mean all the three we have the good thing about helm is they are
1:21:22
maintaining the versioning or the history. So guys if I create run history command
1:21:30
history okay of of name called sorry my web. So
1:21:39
from here I can see this package has three history. One they we go for version one
1:21:48
then version two and version three. Okay. First one we used in then we superseded with this we didn't subed
1:21:54
with this last one. This is the version of the chart has been deployed. Okay. Or maybe there might possibility.
1:22:01
Okay. What are the version three guys you launch was not working great. So we
1:22:06
can very quickly roll back. Okay. So how can we roll back? You can use helm
1:22:12
command and say helm command. I want to roll back. Okay. My uh this particular uh uh
1:22:19
package and I know version one was working great. So I just give my version
1:22:25
one name and one click guys they roll back very much successful. And you guys
1:22:30
know in the version one I don't have three ports. I had only one port. Now we
1:22:35
can quickly verify you have only one portal and also in the version one I don't had a service you know one one
1:22:41
click uh service also has been removed. So guys we see very simply very quickly
1:22:47
we are managing the entire uh package or or I can set the app here with the help
1:22:54
okay and now third fourth version come up okay so till third version we had one
1:22:59
service three replica in fourth version we don't have but if you think now I
1:23:05
need the same three version so I can we can roll back with the same third
1:23:10
right and they keep on creating new history and Now in third version because we had that time three ports and
1:23:16
services. So all the thing again come back. Okay. So very quick into change
1:23:22
your environment. So sometime managing the strategies also this is always always great. Okay. But
1:23:30
now one let me add one more interesting concept here. Right now this chart or
1:23:35
package we have created. Okay. So example we are the one of team of let's say web server team. we create this
1:23:43
entire um package. Okay. But if you guys see here, this package is very much
1:23:49
hardcoded. Hardcoded means if I share this package to anyone, package means I can share
1:23:56
this folder or maybe I can I can uh compress this folder, create a archive and share to somebody else. Okay. So
1:24:05
after I share this folder, anybody can again u you know
1:24:11
you know uncompress or uncarch archive
1:24:16
this folder and they can use helm install command to install it. But what they will finally have they will have a
1:24:22
three replica they will have a service with a node port. They have a
1:24:27
deployment. So whatever I put in my template or my uh resources they will
1:24:33
give get exactly the same but there might be possibility. Okay for example
1:24:38
this package we have created the name is called my web.
1:24:45
Okay and here I put that uh I need u I need uh for example my my port number is
1:24:53
80. I need my type of my service is node port. I I have my replica is three.
1:25:04
This what I have put in my code is called hardcoded. But maybe same package when I reach to my uh QA team or my
1:25:10
testing team or my other team they might don't require a port number because maybe they have port already be consumed
1:25:18
or maybe blocked by firewall. They are want to launch a different port number. They don't want to use node port. they
1:25:24
want to use a cluster IP load balancer they want don't want to go for three replica they want to go for 10 replica
1:25:31
so either after they launch they manually change the replica you know with cubectl uh scale command
1:25:39
again guys if they if they have to do it manually there's no meaning to get the package so I want everything to be
1:25:44
managed by help okay for this what we have to do okay all the file that launch
1:25:51
these things there's here called template file is we have to make this file very much dynamic
1:25:59
means we can pass the input in this file by somehow. Okay. So this is called guys
1:26:07
parameterized. How we can do is something like this is good practice normally. So you know guys
1:26:15
what feature you think your final team might want to change. Okay. So maybe
1:26:20
let's say you you want to give them a f flexibility while installing the
1:26:27
while installing the um you know this uh software I'm giving you by default three
1:26:34
replica this is by default but if you want to change you can change it for
1:26:39
this I'm creating one file this called variable file guys normally variable file we create in the same folder where
1:26:46
a chart file with the name called values doml
1:26:52
Okay. So this is the variable file we are creating here. Okay. And um
1:26:58
normally we you have to use a yl full form otherwise sometime they won't able to read. Okay. So I'm creating values
1:27:05
file. It is like a variable file. And here I'm giving a variable let's say x equals to three. We can give any
1:27:12
variable name maybe r. But because normally we have to give lot of variables. So always good practice to
1:27:18
give a variable with that has a proper logic right let's say a replica count or
1:27:23
replica replication count something like this so you can give any variable it is just a variable name because it is a vir
1:27:29
file you have to use colon then some number so this is one variable I created here
1:27:34
okay this is just a v variable and now what I'm doing here in my template
1:27:40
or my deployment because we know deployment is the one who will who will launch a replica for me so I go to
1:27:46
deployment And here instead we fix value three we can use this variable name here.
1:27:54
So we're telling this replica keyword that I'm not giving three number as a
1:28:00
fix means I'm not hard coding this number. Okay. If you want to get a number replica you want go to this
1:28:06
variable and get the value from here. But how they come to this is variable name. So for this you have to use this
1:28:13
syntax and this is the first time guys we are doing this syntax in this file. Okay curly brace. So if you put anything
1:28:18
in the double curly braces in your template file this guy is or helm considered this guy as a variable.
1:28:27
But how they come to know this variable is there in the values file. So they have a pre-defined keyword here. It's
1:28:32
called dot values. Means this variable is there in my
1:28:38
in my um uh what do you say in uh in uh in a values file. So go to the
1:28:46
values file in our home directory of the package. Home dot means home directory
1:28:52
package. You can find this variable and whatever value you have replace here. So
1:28:57
technically this concept is something like this right rather than we hardcoded the value here
1:29:04
we're asking replica you get your value from this from this variable okay this
1:29:10
is called parameterize because this variable is known as parameter
1:29:15
okay now technically if I deploy this chart same thing we
1:29:21
will get nothing new because in this file we ask get the value from this variable and the
1:29:27
value of this variable I set in this file again the three so technically it should look like again three but because
1:29:34
I created a parameter now this parameter make my things very dynamic what I mean by this let me show you so what I'm
1:29:41
doing here uh just to just to give a idea uh and create a
1:29:49
create a you know kind of simulation here let's say this is not my computer
1:29:54
so what I'm doing here I'm just deleting my my
1:30:00
Helm chart and after delete obviously every resource that is launched by this guy has been dep has been removed. So
1:30:08
everything has been removed. Okay. So just one click everything is removed. Okay. Now let's let's think
1:30:15
this chart I have shared to other team member. Let's say I am the team member
1:30:21
and I have downloaded this chart from somewhere maybe from the GitHub also. You can put in the GitHub also. I download it here. After download in my
1:30:30
um in my computer, I will use Helm and I'll install this chart
1:30:36
with my name for example viml work. Okay. But you know guys when I run this
1:30:45
okay this has a file called value and this value has a variable called uh some
1:30:53
something that has three value. So if I run this, they will launch in network
1:31:00
cluster uh three ports. Okay, pretty straightforward. But what I'm doing here, let me do one more time. Uh one
1:31:06
more time, let me delete viml system. Everything has been removed
1:31:14
again. Okay. Now what other team can do after they have this software?
1:31:20
Okay. they can ask the software. They can ask the
1:31:25
software that I just want to see uh and I just want do you have any
1:31:33
values any parameter in this chart
1:31:38
or everything is hardcoded? Everything hardcoded means whatever you have put here exactly same replica or same thing
1:31:44
I have to use in the same way. So they say yes I have one value of parameter
1:31:51
set with this one. Okay. And they guys always give variable name uh such a name that that clearly
1:31:58
identify what exactly they are doing. So this this identifier if you use this chart they will create a replica account
1:32:04
three. So if you use again install they will
1:32:09
create a replica account three but but this is different team maybe they have a different requirement and they don't want to use a replica account 3. So they
1:32:16
can override this variable and for this there's option called happen set and
1:32:22
they say this is the variable they have value is uh three but I want to override
1:32:27
in my environment. So one click everything is same but it has been
1:32:33
override. Okay. So finally helm chart has been installed.
1:32:40
Okay. At this time this team decided their own uh you know own uh way of
1:32:49
using this chart. You see seven uh code has been launched. So it is it is uh
1:32:57
again the wish of uh of u the guy who
1:33:02
developed this chart what thing they want to param par. For example, in my laptop, if you want to change the uh
1:33:09
service port number or maybe maybe I want to change my strategy of deployment or maybe I want to change my size of PVC
1:33:17
store, I can't change those thing is not parameterized either. I can directly go inside the file and manually change
1:33:24
there's a different point if you know about the Kubernetes that's what I can do here. I can go here and change
1:33:31
directly in the file. But mostly normally we not everybody's very
1:33:37
comfortable of yl file and that is the reason we create a values for those guys
1:33:43
and we know this for this package these are the very commonly uh change value so
1:33:49
we provide these values as a parameter so they can change it let me say take one more example here one more example
1:33:55
here let's say u let's say I'm going to create one more value
1:34:03
in my chart. So in my chart and let's say my plan is
1:34:09
to um change something in uh service.
1:34:15
Okay. So so I'm creating a service as a variable. You can give anything and I
1:34:22
say my service and maybe guys in the service you want to change two things. So you can create
1:34:27
two variable. Let's say type equals to node port and port equals to 80.
1:34:36
So guys you know this is a pure yl file. So in the vl file this is a a kind of
1:34:42
variable and this variable contain two variables like a dictionary.
1:34:47
Okay. So if you want to use this variable then path of this variable is my service dot type my service.
1:34:55
So technically what I mean by this. Okay. Okay. So in my template file,
1:35:01
my template file of service, I say service, okay, your uh type is not port is not
1:35:09
fixed. I want to parameterize this part. Now go to your values file. There's a
1:35:15
variable called my service and this variable has some more sub variable called key. This is called type.
1:35:22
Take the value from there. Okay. Whatever value they have update here. So this part I have parameterized
1:35:29
same thing I'm not fixing the uh port number 80 or you guys you know one more there is one more port called node port
1:35:38
so by you guys know I told you in my service classes the node port is randomly they pick I say I don't want to
1:35:44
fix the node port randomly so I want take this value from my service variable
1:35:50
and with the variable called port. So we will decide uh what uh uh note
1:35:57
port we would like to use. Okay. So it's some so two things we parameter here is
1:36:06
now let me first delete my helm chart or
1:36:11
you don't have to delete you can uh upgrade also but if you want to upgrade
1:36:19
change your version let's say four okay so one more small thing I'm doing
1:36:26
here just for a small reason I'm just changing the port to uh let's say Oh 22.
1:36:32
Okay. Now if I use helm upgrade
1:36:38
upgrade u vimmel ws this is my
1:36:43
chart name from the folder called my web. This is the location where we have
1:36:49
the code. Okay. And this time guys again they go to values file. whatever the
1:36:55
value I have hardcoded they they pick or maybe you can change the set and say I
1:37:01
have a service variable and I want to change the service variable uh my service variable uh port number I to
1:37:08
change to let's say 330 okay so
1:37:14
so actually uh unknown field come up
1:37:20
okay why so uh guess field name is not right uh very one minute very quickly.
1:37:26
Let me check Kubernetes
1:37:32
uh service node
1:37:37
port. Uh so I write wrong. I think node port
1:37:43
is right here. Node port is a keyword. Let me very
1:37:49
quickly check again. But is a node port right?
1:37:56
Ctrl F node port. Yeah, it is right. Maybe I have given the wrong spelling.
1:38:04
My web template service
1:38:09
is node port right. It's same right?
1:38:14
Why is there node port?
1:38:21
one minute I say sorry n is small
1:38:28
node port and is small okay so I run this
1:38:34
okay it's not a valid guys node port have a fixed range between this they
1:38:40
work they work between this range only there's a limitation from the kubernetes so let me change the range to this one
1:38:49
Enter. Okay. Uh so 33 again the bigger range.
1:38:55
So let me use 30,0001. Okay. The upgrade right. And now if you
1:39:01
see very quickly you have your again service come up and you decide your own
1:39:06
port number for the node port. Okay. So it is like this. So guys now uh
1:39:13
it means uh if you have a good knowledge in Yl file that you have because the way
1:39:19
I start my training we focus more in VML file and almost all the main keyword. So
1:39:26
all the WL file you can put here and as soon as you guys deploy this
1:39:31
chart deploy this chart um automatically
1:39:38
automatically entire chart has been installed or good way uh is always
1:39:43
parameterized parameterized your your your chart. So
1:39:50
anybody who want to use your chart uh they can uh they can customize they can
1:39:55
customize accordingly the way they want. So guys this is a way to uh to create
1:40:01
your own chart but there's a lot of stat chart available in the market publicly.
1:40:07
You can also download those chart and install it. So if you very quickly go for a site called helm
1:40:14
okay hels is official site. Okay. To manage the Kubernetes software package
1:40:20
manager for Kubernetes. Okay. If you go down there's a public
1:40:27
repository get chart and name repos called artifact hub.
1:40:33
Okay. If you click here. So this is the repository public
1:40:39
repository where thousands of packages available. Okay. So a lot of community guys
1:40:46
has created a package and upload here. So almost all the main packages use
1:40:52
cases because uh you can find for example let's let's talk of WordPress
1:41:00
okay is available here. Okay. And it's also verified. So rather than you can
1:41:05
create your own own WordPress u you know yml file then your own uh chart you can
1:41:12
just d download
1:41:17
this uh package and install it okay and one installed entire WordPress you know
1:41:23
your front end back end everything has been installed for you and because this is very verified and have a lot of
1:41:29
reading here so they have created WordPress package uh in very much mature
1:41:35
way whatever the better use cases wise they they put over here but if you guys
1:41:42
see a lot of categories machine learning monitoring networking security almost all the major
1:41:48
possible packages you have it will be available here okay so guys I want to give you one task
1:41:55
very important task so whichever guys technology you guys are comfortable on
1:42:01
okay just try to uh create a chart for the technology
1:42:08
then create account here and upload your your uh package and
1:42:14
upload your chart here. Okay. So it means for example you guys may be uh
1:42:21
let's say um good in Hadoop for example. So maybe there might be no Hadoop
1:42:27
package available. Maybe they might be available but after you verify that Hadoop and you've come to know this
1:42:33
Hadoop has no great feature normally what we we looking for. So just go and
1:42:39
create your own Hadoop package and chart and uh then upload here. So other
1:42:44
community member can can use can give a feedback and you you guys you can
1:42:49
technically you are showcasing your your uh your knowledge in this field. Maybe
1:42:56
you get a great link or job or good projects and the good company links reference. So lots of benefit you going
1:43:02
to have. So anybody who was there in my anible same thing we did in anible also. So in anible we have anible galaxy. Same
1:43:09
thing here for kubernetes helm we have artifact hub. Okay. Even though somebody
1:43:16
name user called ground hog 2k and has uploaded WordPress. Same thing you can
1:43:21
also also do over here. H so this is one uh
1:43:27
one uh homework kind of thing you can take from my side. I highly recommend it. But yeah for the earth student it is
1:43:33
compulsor. So whatever guys uh field you're good in maybe in Hadoop maybe
1:43:39
WordPress maybe machine learning or XYZ just go and create first all the YML
1:43:47
file and put in one box called chart and upload here and I suggest most try to
1:43:52
put as much as parameter like as as a homework but let me show
1:43:58
you guys how to install WordPress for example if you click here. Okay. So uh so technically this is the one URL where
1:44:05
uh you can uh find the software. So this URL guys is known as is known as repository. But like this there would be
1:44:13
lot of repository where you can find the help package. Okay. So right now in my helm if you ask in my helm do you know
1:44:21
any repository from where to download? So they say I don't know anything about repository.
1:44:28
Okay. So if you want me to download something I don't know from where to download.
1:44:34
Okay. So first of all guys you have to configure the rep. So anybody who know Linux Reddit the way you configure yum
1:44:41
something like this you have to configure. So even though guys they give me help if you want to add a rep this is
1:44:46
URL you can put so I'm putting this URL. So technically you have to add this rep
1:44:53
once. So we are giving the URL URL this guy where you can find the
1:44:58
software the name of the URL is bit name you can give anything it's just a name it's just a name
1:45:05
now if you want to install any software what software added available
1:45:11
in this URL you can store for example if you want to see all the uh software available in
1:45:18
this URL so I can say search for this hub uh let's say I'm searching for
1:45:24
WordPress. Okay. So what you see here because this
1:45:32
search command search in a hub. This is one of my hub public hub and the we search WordPress
1:45:39
and and this is the WordPress uh related software available there. So
1:45:45
multiple software you have same thing you can see from web UIs and plus they also tell you the command how to install
1:45:51
it. Okay. So,
1:45:56
one minute. Let me share this commands.
1:46:03
Guys, so you can use this command.
1:46:10
It will install warm. Where is the command?
1:46:19
You can use this command. So technically this command
1:46:25
go to this rep means this one it is anything name in this they look for
1:46:31
WordPress
1:46:37
one they look for uh WordPress okay and uh they download this WordPress
1:46:45
chart means package and they install with this name with this
1:46:52
The same commut come okay and by chance the guy who create
1:46:59
this package they add some extra note so after this package install this note
1:47:04
printed this note is guiding us that that if you guys don't know anything about cubernetes then you can use cubes
1:47:11
you'll get command to find a URL so that you can connect so they're giving some extra help
1:47:17
over here to guiding us but because we know all the commands so we don't need any guidance. Okay. So if you see here
1:47:24
cubectl uh get deployment so guys this
1:47:29
deployment automatically launch and this deployment launch a port. So this board
1:47:34
of MySQL database and WordPress has been okay has been launched for us.
1:47:41
Okay. But why uh why they are in the pending state? Okay. But because guys
1:47:46
this board uh require PVC
1:47:51
and PVC is not yet created because in this cluster we don't have a storage class. Okay. Guys if you remember my
1:47:58
storage class we discussed in our mini cube in the mini cube storage class was there. So storage automatically create a
1:48:04
PVC for and this PVC is attached. So guys you can create a storage class first by yourself then it will
1:48:10
automatically create a PVC and attach to this guy. But technically you don't have to attach anything PVC they automatic
1:48:15
create portic create service create or whatever they uh they're looking for everything has been created for this
1:48:22
guy. So one click one command everything has been installed for us but you can
1:48:28
install only those software that is available in this URL. Okay. But then like this there will be lot of URL.
1:48:35
Okay. A lot of URL um from where you can download the
1:48:41
software. Uh you can add the URL and then you can download software. So adding the URL is called repo add and
1:48:47
for downloading um Helm install command. You can search
1:48:53
search command. So pretty straightforward nothing very uh special here. So this is a way you can download
1:48:59
the software from some of the you all okay but otherwise the main part is how to create your own chart that's what
1:49:06
guys I have uh I have discussed over here so uh that's all guys uh about u the
1:49:15
helm highly suggest whatever the technology you are comfortable on and you comfortable on whichever the uh yl
1:49:23
file right create your own chart test it here. Okay. And then uh share with other
1:49:30
team members. Put in the GitHub or I highly suggest create account in this uh
1:49:37
hub and post there to share with other team members also. That's all guys for
1:49:42
today. Uh any questions if you have um you can you can discuss with me.
1:49:49
Any good if you have
1:50:20
So uh
1:50:27
thank you guys uh for lot of uh this uh feedback. I'll I I'm trying guys my best
1:50:32
uh as much as I can especially for the earth guys whatever best we can do for
1:50:37
you guys right uh when this program uh
1:50:45
is start when this program start we guys update you soon when we start uh this this
1:50:52
program okay
1:50:59
So uh
1:51:12
so there's there a lot of uh uh I can see uh
1:51:18
lot of comments about my announcement but I'm looking for
1:51:25
any queries here. uh parameter file look like no hurry uh
1:51:30
it is not JSON file it is a pure yl file
1:51:35
it pure y file if you see it is pure uh yl file okay so I think what what you
1:51:44
that's what you're asking about over here
1:51:55
So it is good to invest money in kubernet
1:52:02
exam or actually this the good thing is about especially in 218 exam it is having a title kubernetes and the open
1:52:08
source. So in one certificate both the title come up. So anybody has this certificate it but they have a
1:52:15
knowledge in kubernetes also and they have a knowledge in uh open sift also.
1:52:20
Okay. Otherwise if you want to go for kubernet exam that's also good ck but it's only for kubernetes. If you go for
1:52:26
ck right that is also good.
1:52:32
Can chart be held can no mohammmed actually ensible is very different use case and kubernetes is very different
1:52:39
use case. In nible we create a role that is for configuration management. In
1:52:44
kubernetes we create a chart right. It is for deployment purpose. Means you want to deploy the resource in
1:52:50
the Kubernetes that managed by Helm chart.
1:52:57
Okay.
1:53:13
Uh can you play explain the helper function? Uh definitely uh Bachu uh I'll
1:53:19
definitely explain you helper because if you uh see some of the uh chart if you
1:53:24
get a chart with credit come also they give you underscore helper uh function they also have some use case u let's
1:53:31
let's me try to take some discussion on this in my uh future classes
1:53:43
uh no yua I'm I'm think I'm pron pronouncing your
1:53:48
names uh properly. Uh Helm is not a Kubernetes resources. It is just a uh
1:53:54
client binary. Okay, means u you can use this software
1:54:00
at your client or user site to just to manage the other cubin resources. I
1:54:05
think by by seeing this today's complete demo you might understood
1:54:20
in future can we implement kubernetes based pipeline session uh akas uh I
1:54:26
don't know which exactly pipeline uh in the cubage you're talking about but normally uh we can create a great
1:54:33
pipeline end toend pipeline deployment pipeline and other pipelines normally we integrate kubernetes for the genkins
1:54:39
with the genkins so they the together work and we can build uh multiple
1:54:45
different kind of pipelines for different purpose right so maybe I don't know you are the part of genkins
1:54:50
training also or not so soon we are coming with genin training I think from first week of March so I'll take this
1:54:58
kind of lot of use cases there to get a pipeline and that pipeline can take multiple tool one of the tool would be
1:55:04
cuber There it is.
1:55:16
Yes. Indicate Jen Genin training will cover all the official content of the examination. So after the training of
1:55:22
Jenkins, you can appear for genin official exam also.
1:55:50
Will any training for 4 to5? No guys uh 4 to5 printing uh will be not conduct
1:55:57
again. I already delivered 425 frame. So again there's no possibility for 425.
1:56:05
There is about the open sift security actually.
1:56:14
As soon as you get template chart will automatically launch. No no uh chan uh after get template we have to rerun the
1:56:19
chart or upgrade the chart. Okay. So it won't automatically run.
1:56:26
We can add some other program that will automatic launch for us. Uh codiness
1:56:32
node definitity is pending. No uh social program is not complete today. I know uh it is pending. It's not pending. It's in
1:56:39
the process. We will take this topic in my next classes.
1:56:52
Uh if you see uh if you're using version Helm version two and using Prometheus
1:56:57
and Gaffana online repo error you getting the chart is this is not because of Helm version two. Mostly normally
1:57:04
from wherever you are uh you are uh downloading the chart for Prometheus or
1:57:09
Gafana normally in the description they add in the description they add that
1:57:15
that has been depreciated means they're talking about they have more a new uh chart come up with this or maybe they
1:57:22
have renamed the weather so normally in the description they put this thing so
1:57:27
this is normal where you see it is in deprecated okay but I don't think so Because of Helm version two this kind of
1:57:34
a challenge come because Helm version two and three just a way different way to manage the things otherwise um almost
1:57:40
your template file internal code for the equipment is same okay the help version
1:57:45
two and version three file and output perspective there's no so much difference come
1:58:02
uh there's any prerequisite for one do no uh Krishna there is no prerequisite for do 180 I will take this topic uh
1:58:10
form very basics again there's no prerequisite
1:58:28
so uh
1:58:35
How to add notes in the chart. So I highly suggest guys after you download chart from somebody else open the chart
1:58:43
you will see lots of thing some extra information you also get. For example if you want to see how they add the notes.
1:58:50
So just open download chart we can very clearly see how they add the extra nodes. Okay. So almost all the core
1:58:57
conso chart I explained to you but that's much small things you can look to other chart from this uh
1:59:07
for this right nothing for abroad student from uh actually anybody who is
1:59:13
planning to go for examination from India
1:59:18
maybe you are abroad student but if you have any plan to appear examination from
1:59:23
India then this offer for you Okay. But by chance because we as alliance for
1:59:29
word come into under the redhead India. So uh this offer ready India means we
1:59:36
come into we can deliver any rate training to across the world but but
1:59:42
ready India actually come up with this offer. So so we can't extend this offer
1:59:48
to any other citizen of other countries.
1:59:58
Uh so uh
2:00:08
so I will guys also upload this uh this folder
2:00:14
this folder uh of today what I created you can also try the same way
2:00:24

2:00:29
