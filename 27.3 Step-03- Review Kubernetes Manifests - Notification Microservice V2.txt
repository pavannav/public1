In this lecture we are going toreview the deployment manifestand also the English manifests requiredfor our application deployment.So in step three we are going to reviewthe deployment manifest for V2 notification service.So we are going to distribute 50% draftto each of the V1 and V2 version of application.So NSV1 replicas are twoand then NSV2 replicas are two.We have put it there, even one oneif you put also it is going to be 50% traffic.So if you see here this is thenotification microservice deployment zero four.This is V1 notification and we have two replicasand zero eight V2 notification.We have two replicas.Okay? And the next thing is verify meanslike the change one isin the zero eight V2 notification microserviceyour image tag should be 4.0.0 a double s x-ray.So verify the same thing.It is the same.And if you go for a V1it should be 3.0.0 a double s x-ray.So that looks good.And next is change to new environmental variableswill be added here so these things are going to be samewhich is XLA context missing and then X name and address.But X-ray tracing namewe are going to give it as V2 notification microserviceso that you get the name here.V2 notification microservice infrom x-ray picture visual service map view.Okay, so that's about notificationmicroservice related review of that respect to manifest andrest all manifests are same my ask user managementfrom previous sections.It is coming as is so we really don't need toworry about them.So next we will move on to ingress manifest.Okay, so let's go to ingress manifest.And first thing is SSL certificate.This is for you in the senselike whenever you are using this manifestplease add your SSL certificate here and here.And the second thing is external dns, right?So for external dns, so you can use meanslike I'm using Canary demo dot coupon cloud.com.In your case, the coupon cloud.com might be somethingof your domain.com.So that's about the ingress manifest changes.And if you want we can even changeE case micro services demo and the name of this is Canary.If you want we can even add this way foreveringress manifest name.Okay, so that's about it.So rest all looks good.And then as is, so in our next lecturewe are going to deploy and then test the stuff.So I'll see you in the next lecture.Until then, bye bye.Thank you.
