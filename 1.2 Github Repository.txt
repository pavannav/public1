# 1.2 Github Repository

-: Welcome back.In this lecture, we are going to look into threeGitHub repositories available for this masterclass course.So we'll have AWS EKS Kubernetes Masterclassunder StackSimplify, and also two more repositories.You can see it here under the course modules,for Docker Fundamentals, one repository,and Kubernetes Fundamentals, one more repository.So, in detail, you'll have everywhere, wherever you go,you'll have a step-by-step documentationavailable for all the things.So everywhere you'll finda detailed step-by-step instructionsincluding the kubectl commands you need to deployand the Docker images you need to execute and everything.So all these three repositories,you can either fork it and then log into your GitHub repo,and then fork it so that you have everything at your placemeans like at your GitHub repo,or you can download them as a zip and then unzipand then use it from your local desktop.So anything is fine.So now, if you see here, so all these things, right?So one more thing you need to understand hereis in every of the sections, in any of these sections,you'll find something called kube manifests folder.So inside that only you'll findall your Kubernetes manifestsfor whatever the use case you are implementingeverything will be found there.So when you're progressing through the courseyou are going to understand in detailbut I am just trying to explain youthat the kube manifest folder is for mainly holdingthe Kubernetes manifest in entire course.This completes the introductory partof Kubernetes Masterclass in AWS.So we'll start with the hands-on exercisesfrom our next lecture.Primarily we'll start with the creating a EKS clusterusing EKS CTL in our next lecture.So I'll see you in the next lecture.Until then, bye bye.Thank you.
