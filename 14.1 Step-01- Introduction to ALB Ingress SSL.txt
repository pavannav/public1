# 14.1 Step-01- Introduction to ALB Ingress SSL

-: Welcome back.In this section we are going to implement theKubernetes Ingress SSL use case.So let's understand the tasks involvedas part of this ALB Ingress SSL use case.And before going to tasks,we also need to know that we are also goingto introduce two more services as part of this use case.Which is AWS Route 53 and AWS Certificate Manager.So as part of task one,we are going to register a new domain in AWS Route 53.So this is just to learn how to register a domainin our AWS Route 53.And as part of task two,we are going to create a SSL certificatein AWS Certificate Manager.And as part of task three,we are going to update the SSL annotationsin the Ingress service,and deploy those Kubernetes manifestsand then test it using task four.So let's also understand the network design for this.So whatever we are seeing currently,is a network design we have used and seenalready in the Context Path Based Route Routinguse case or demo.So now we are also going to add AWS Route 53related service here and also ensure that we registera new domain inside this Route 53 service.And we are also going to create a SSL certificatein the Certificate Manager Service.And we are also going to update our Ingress Servicewith SSL related annotations.And finally, we are also going to DNS registerour application load balancer DNS name,with a custom DNS name with the, with something likeSSL Demo Docs, taxsimplified.comin the Route 53 Azure record.And whenever we access HTTP URLs,all three applications, app one, app two and then app three,should be accessible for us.And we, we will be also able to access usingHTTPS, SSL Demo Docs taxsimplified.comfor all the three applicationswith their respective context path.And in next demo, in addition to this,we are also going to implement a SSL redirect.So whenever you access the HTTP URLs also,it will directly redirect to HTTP URLs.But that is in the next demo.In this demo, we will see the URLs in a independent modelwhere you can access the applicationwith both HTTP and also HTTPS URLs.Now, to register a domain in AWS Route 53,already taxsimplified.com is a registered domainwhich we are using for all of our websites.So that said, to implement or demonstrate this use case,we are going to use a new domain named, cubancloud.com.So this completes the introductorypart of Ingress SSL use case.In our next lecture we'll go aheadand then practically implement this.So I'll see you in the next lecture.Until then, bye bye.Thank you.
