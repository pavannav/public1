# 4.13 Step-10- Kubernetes Deployment  - Introduction

-: Welcome back.In this lecture we are going to understandabout one more Kubernetes core concept, called Deployments.So we have already seen a Kubernetes clusterwith two worker nodes and two podsin each worker node, from a replicaset.So now deployment is going to be superset of replicaset.Which means replicaset can provide a few features.And when we call deployment as a superset,it can provide many, many features for us, okay.So in addition to what replicaset provides.So that's about the deployment advantage we have.and there is no difference in accessing the applicationshosted via replicaset or deployment.So all, it is going to be usingthe service concept in Kubernetes.So now let's go ahead and then seewhat are the deployment features available for us,or what it provides for usor for our applications hosted on Kubernetes.So we can create a deployment to roll out a replicaset.By default, whenever we create a deployment,a replicaset it is rolled out.And updating the deployment.So whenever we want to change our application version,update our application version,we can do the update of the deployment.When we do this, automatically our version,whatever we are going to update, it is going to be recorded.So now using that, we can easily roll backto our respective older deployment, whatever we want,because it is maintaining the versions.Or if you have updated from V1 to V2, V2 to V3,and then V3 to V4.And now again, if you want to go back to V2, yes,you will be able to gobecause it maintains the versions, and then version history.So now we will be also able to scale our deployments.So how we have done the scaling in replicasets,in the same way in deployment also, we'll have a tagof replicas where we can add the number of replicas.We can add it, or we can use kubectl scaleto scale our deployment.And we can even pause and resume a deployment.So in deployment, the core thing here is, like wheneveryou apply a change to your deployment,immediately it will be applied to your pods.So that is the thing.So if you want to make multiple changes, then you reallydon't want the pods to be recreated,or terminated and recreated every second for every change.So you have 10 changes to make to your deployment.Then pause the deployment and make all the changes,and then resume the deployment so that all those changeswill be applied to your deployment at a time.So like this, there are multiple thingswe can take an advantage using the deployment.So whenever you are doing the deployment, you can evenget the rollout status or deployment status.And there will be something called cleanup policy.Cleanup policy is nothing but...So whenever we do the updating of our deployments,it maintains the rollout version history.And by default, it maintainslast 10 versions of our application.So we can go to that respective version using that.Or we will be able to add more number of versionsby adding additional tag in our YAML manifestunder the spec of the deployment.We'll see that in the later cases if you want to.And next thing is canary deployments.So if we want to add a new versionof our application in the live production traffic,and the traffic should distributewith old version and the new version,still we'll be able to do it using canary deployments.So all these things are available for us with deployment.So let's go ahead and then create a simple deployment objectand then expose it as a service,and then access it via a browser, and then test it once.After that, again, we'll move on to updating the deployment,rollbacking the deployment, or pausing and resuming.All those things we are going to see step-by-step now.So I'll see you in the next lecture.Until then, bye-bye.Thank you.
