# 17.1 Step-01- Introduction to Ingress SSL Discovery

-: Welcome back.In this section we are goingto learn about the Kubernetes Ingress conceptSSL discovery with host and TLS.So we are going to implement two demosas part of this concept.So now let's go and understandwhat exactly is this SSL certificate discovery, right?So if you see here,this is SSL certificate discovery using host.So if you see in the rules earlier,we have already implemented the host header base routing.So where you have seen the app 101.stacksimplify.comand app 201.stacksimplify.com,where specified in the Ingress ruleswith the host as the argument.So here, TLS certificates for ALB listenerscan be automatically discovered with host namesfrom Ingress resources.So if the ALB Ingress related certificate ARNis not specified.In simple terms,when you are using this host header base routing, right?So from these host valuesyou have given that DNS name here very clearly,app101.stacksimplify.com.So which means you really don't needto provide this certificate ARNand related annotation and provide the ARNof your SSL certificate from your certificate manager.So by default, Ingress can directlytake the available certificate for these nameswhich means if the name matches stacksimplify.com.So if you have something called star.stacksimplify.comso that matches these domain namesapp101.stacksimplify.com and app201.stacksimplify.comSo automatically it'll take thatand then associate with your Ingress service.So which is nothing,but it'll associate with your application load balancer.We explicitly don't needto define this certificate ARN annotation.So which means which is a very good thingthat we don't need to go to our certificate managerand go to that respective certificateand get the ARN and hard code that ARN in the service,we don't need to do all those tasks.So automatically it is goingto take it with this SSL discovery with host option,whenever you are using the host base rules.In addition to that, any other rules,not the host base rules,you are doing the context part base routing, right?So at that point of timeyou are using only a default backend of something.So at that point of time,so it can also use something called a TLS field.So in the next demowe are going to see the TLS field related demo.So the controller will attempt to discover TLS certificatesfrom the TLS field in the Ingressand host field in the Ingress rules.So this part you have seen host field in the Ingress rules,you already seen here.And in the next demo we are going to,in the next slide we are going to see that TLS field relatedthing too.And another important note hereis you need to explicitly specifyto use HTTPS listener with listen ports annotation.And anyway we are going to do thatand we have already seen in our Ingress resources also.So you can see we are already specifyingthe listen ports 443 for our SSL communication.So we have no issues with this important node.So now let's come back to this demo two,which is SSL discovery with TLS.So here if you see your DNS name you have provided usstart to discover a TLS 901.stacksimplify.com.You have something called your default backend.And here there is no host rules here.This is simple context port-based routingrelated example, right?So at that point when you are using other than host.And then if you want to use,if you want to auto detect your SSL certificateand associate with your Ingress service,which means it need to associatewith your application load balancer,you can also use this TLS optionand provide with TLS hosts and provide your host names here,star.stacksimplify.com.So automatically this related certificatewill be associated with your Ingress resourcer service,which means whenever we are implementingthese SSL certificate discovery in Ingressusing host or TLS options,we really don't need to have this annotation enabled.So you can go ahead and then commend this certificate hereand related annotation in your both demos.So this completes the introductory partof SSL discovery using host and TLS in Ingress.In our next demo,in our next lecturewe are going to practically go aheadand then implement these things.So I'll see you in the next lecture.Until then, bye bye.Thank you.
