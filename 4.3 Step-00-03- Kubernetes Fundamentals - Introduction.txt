# 4.3 Step-00-03- Kubernetes Fundamentals - Introduction

-: Welcome back.In this lecture, we are going to understandabout humanity's fundamental core conceptspart replicate, deployment, and serviceon a very high level.So, let's understand what are those actually.Right?So, part is it, single instanceof an application.So, a part is the smallest object that you cancreate in.Cuban that is.When you come into reply-closet,a replicloset will maintain a stableset of replica parts, learning at any given time.So in short, it is often used to guaranteethe availability of specified numberof identical parts in it, deployment.So a deployment runs multiple replicasof our application,and automatically replaces any instancethat fails or becomes unresponsive.So, roll out and roll back changes to applicationserve additional features about the deploymentwhen you create it as a deployment.So, deployments are well suited forstateless applications.And finally, service.So a service is an abstraction for partsprorating a stable so-called, what shall I be?Address, fronting these parts.Same term, in simple terms, service sitsin front of a board, and then access itload balancer.So this is a very high level introductionabout these things.But, in upcoming lectures,whenever we deal with each section,so we are going to have a very detailedpictographical and then visual manualon what we are doing.And equal intel.Hands on sections, okay.So now, we'll move on and then understandwhat is our approach in implementingthese fundamentals.Right?So, we are going to use both approacheswhich is nothing but imperatuand then declaratu vey.Of, implementing that humanities core concepts,okay.So, using QCTL with QCTL commands,we are going to create part deploymentand then service, imperatively.And, for replicloset we really don't havea QCTL command to directly do it,so we are going to use EML file to create that.In the declaratu approach, so we are going to useEML as our language to create the(inaudible) manifest, and then useQCTL to create part replicate deploymentand then service and then understandand then master these concepts, hand to handusing evenda live template writing using AML also.So all in all, we are going to do thisin two ways which is, one is imperatuveand the declaratuve.And, over the process, everything right?So everything is documented in it.(inaudible) on a step by step manner.So if you go to parts with cube CTLevery step and then every command, whateveryou are going to execute,everything will be available for youin a step by step manner so that we reallydon't fail anywhere or stuck anywherewhen we are implementing it, okay.So if you see services, with QCTL whatevercommands you want to use,everything you are going to use.And if you see services with iyamel,so you are going to have a cube manifestwith all the, manifest whatever you are going toright them directly, which means like,you are going to create all these thingsby live template writing and then,implement them.So, that's about that.Introductory section of what we are going to doas part of this course,so I'll see you in the next lectureand then start with that parts with QCTLso until then, bye bye.Thank you.
