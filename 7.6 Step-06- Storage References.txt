# 7.6 Step-06- Storage References

-: Welcome back.So in this lecture we are going to discussabout the references section exclusively, mainly relatedto EBS CSI driver.So I have provided all the links for youfor your additional understanding and then moreabout the features available there and all those things.So this is the core link about our EBS CSI driver.So we can go in there and this is the dynamic provisioningwhatever we have implemented and more examplesare provided here for additional stuff here.So let's go here.Okay, so this is the EBS CSI driver.And if you see the current version it is running is V 0 5 0.And whenever you are testing it might be even 1.0or whatever, right?But whatever it may be the case.So the core thing here we need to understand is here, okay?So whatever the features it provides, static provisioningdynamic provisioning, mount option, NVME, block volumevolume snapshot, and then volume resizingand important things when we are seeing the featuresays all fasted, Okay?So volume resizing and volume snapshot are in alpha Stateand they are sometimes working, sometimes not working.They are in stable as on today.So that's the reason I didn't include these things.Okay, so block volume is in beta stage and the dynamicprovisioning, these are also in betastage, but the thing is they're ready for production.That's what AWS says.So we can use these things happilybut the core thing is whatever you see, Alfa stagesyou crosscheck before you are using for your things meanslike when you want to use resizing, you need tosay allow expansion through in our, in your storage class.Okay? I didn't define that here.Allow expansion through.You need to define an additional tag here, okay?So, but as it is in all frustratedit is not good to add that and then demonstrate it, okay?So it might change the why, because once it comes to betathe changes will be minimal, but if it is in alphathe tag might change or whatever it is.Okay?-: So that's about it.Don't worry about installation stepswhatever here, here provided.So you need to allow, you follow the stepswhatever I have provided herewhich is straight and then easy.And now next thing here isone more thing is this is the one examplesfor EBS CSI driver.So we have implemented dynamic provisioningwith our Myer skill and we havefor block volume and then for resizing.So if you see the resizing allow, I told you right?Allow volume expansion rules.So like this, you can provide all these thingsbut you whatever you want to provide.and then based on your requirementwhat you want to use accordinglyyou can refer these examples means like you can goinside these examples and then go inside the specand then find the example dot AML or whateverand then find the options related to your storage classand then persistent volume accordingly, and then leverageand then use it whenever you're doingin your real time environments basedon the requirement, whatever you have.Okay? So that's about the references section here.Okay? So dynamic provisiondirect link I have provided and resizing snapshotseverything you can see here, all the examples here.Okay? So in our next lecture we'll focuson creating the user management microservicewhich is connectingto the Myer scale database we have created.We'll create some users and then reference themin the database and list those users and everything.And then again, we'll clean up everything.So that's about it.So I'll see you in the next lecture.Until then, bye bye.Thank you.
