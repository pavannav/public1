# 26.1 Step-01- Introduction to Microservices Distributed Tracing using AWS X-Ray

-: Welcome back.In this section, we are going to look into AWS X-rayas one of the tool for microservices distributed tracing.So we are going to deploy our applications on EKSand then, so for those microservices applications,we are going to enable distributed tracing using AWS X-ray.So with that said,we are going to add one more AWS serviceto our entire deploymenton EKS.So moving on,we will see on a very high level,what is AWS X-ray.And then how we are going to deploy it,what is its network architecture.And during the process,we are also going to look into daemonsets in Kubernetes.Why? Because we are going to deployX-ray related application on Kubernetes using daemonsets.So let's see all those things now.So what is X-ray?So let's see how this is going to help us.So AWS X-ray helps us analyze and debugdistributed applications betweenbuild using microservices architecture.With X-ray, we can understand how our applicationand its underlying services are performingto identify and troubleshootthe root cause of performance issues and then errors.So X-ray provides an end-to-end view of our requestas they travel through our application,and shows a map of our application underlying components.So that is a very good feature, right?So if we enable the X-ray,then we are going to getthe end-to-end view of our application,including the components involved inside that.So we can also use X-ray to analyze applicationsin development environmentsand also in production environments.So we can even do this for a simple three-tier applicationsto complex microservices applicationsconsisting of thousands of services.So everywhere we can leverage this X-ray feature.So now the benefits we are going to get isit provides us the,to review the requested behavior came for our application.It also discovers us to allow usto discover the application issues.And it improves our application performancesbecause we are going to discover the issuesearly in advance using the X-ray traces.So it is ready to use with AWS,any of the other services, okay?So design for a variety of applications.So now how X-ray is going to work, okay?So this image, I took it directly from AWS.So I have said it also as a copyright from Amazon.So if you see here,so whatever the X-ray traceswill be collected by the X-ray service.So it will collect the traces and then record those tracesand then group them.Means like traces nothing but groupingour entire application request from starting to ending.If it is a three-tier application,or if it is multiple microservice,one microservice calling other microservice.So will collect the tracesand combine the data generated from each serviceinto a single unit called trace.So it will take and then create it as a traceand then it will show it on our X-ray service map.In addition to that,there will be also a analyze issues featureso that we can go inside each traceand then see the entire flowand then what is happeningand then understand in detailwhere the performance bottlenecks are there,or where, what issue happened exactly.So like that, we can do all the stuff using X-ray.So moving on.So from X-ray perspective,we are going to deploy X-ray related object,means like X-ray related agent on Kubernetesusing daemonsets.So due to that, we need to understand what are daemonsets.So in our next lecture,we are going to understand about daemonsetsand also how we are going to use it in EKS clusterfrom network design perspective and all those things.So I'll see you in the next lecture.Until then, bye bye. Thank you.
