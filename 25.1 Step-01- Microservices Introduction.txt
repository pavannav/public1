# 25.1 Step-01- Microservices Introduction

-: Welcome back.In this section,we are going to deal with microservicesand deploying those microservices on EKS cluster.So, what are these microservices?So let's get a very high level overviewabout what are these microservices,and then we'll move on with the exampleand then deployments.So, microservices, also known asthe microservice architecture.It is an architectural stylethat structures an applicationas a collection of services,that are highly maintainable,and testable.So, they are loosely coupled,independently deployable,and organize their own business capabilities,and owned by a small team.Each microservice can be owned by a small team.So, let's see the benefitswith this microservices architectureand then what all additional,available the things alsowe are going to get,based on microservices.So, from developer perspectiveit is going to be a developer independence.So, small teams work in paralleland can iterate faster than larger teams.Isolation and then resilience.So if a component dies, we spin up anotherwhile and the rest of the applicationcontinues to function.And scalability.Smaller components take up fewer resourcesand can be scaled to meet increasing demandof that component only.So that is one important benefit for us.Life cycle automation.Individual components are easier to fitinto continuous delivery pipelinesand complex deployment scenarios.Not possible with the monoliths.Relationship to the business.So microservices architectureare split along business domain boundaries,increasing independence,and then understanding across the organization.In our next lecture, we are going to take an exampleof microservices and then implement it.So I'll see you in the next lecture.Until then, bye bye.Thank you.
