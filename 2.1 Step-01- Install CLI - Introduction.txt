# 2.1 Step-01- Install CLI - Introduction

-: Welcome back.In this lecture,we are going to understand aboutthree types of CLIs required forour AWS EKS clusters.In simple terms,to manage our application workloads on EKS cluster,we need toinstall three types ofCLIs. Command-line Interfaces.So,the three types are AWS CLA,Cube CTL, and then, EKS CTL.So AWS CLA, we can control multiple AWS servicesfrom the command lineand automate them through the scripts.So, this is a generic definition about AWS CLA.But why we need itfor EKS cluster?So, why we need it islike once we configure the AWS CLAand then provide thesecurity credentials on our local desktopwith AWS CLA using Cube CTLand using EKS CTL,we will be able to manage our clusterand our cluster objects,and also our applications on Kubernetes clusters.So, all those thingsare required for that purpose.We need to primarily install theAWS CLA as the underlying base.Next is the Cube CTL.So Cube CTL,we can control Kubernetes clusters and objects usingCube CTL.So, most of the time in our entire coursewe are going todo everything with Cube CTL only.So, we can see step-by-step in our upcoming lectures.So EKS CTL.So, this is a very, very importantand powerful tool for managing theElastic Kubernetes Service Clusters.So, we even have theAWS Management Consolewherein we will be able to create the clusterand then create the node groups.You'll understand about these objectsin our upcoming lectures."What is this cluster?"And then "What is control play?"and all these things.But for now, need to understand here is likeEKS CTL is thebetter toolthan the AWS Management Console as of today.So if using EKS CTL, we'll be able tocreate and then delete the clusters on AWS EKS.In addition to that, we'll be able to create autoscaleand then delete the node groups.And we'll also be able to create theFargate profiles using EKS CTL.In short,it is a very, very, verypowerful tool for managingEKS clusters on AWS.So, let's go to our GitHub repo and thenlook intoour steps, what we are going to perf.And in zero one EKS create clusters usingEKS CTL.So as a first step, we are going to do theinstall CLIs now.So, in our next lecture we'll focus on installing theAWS CLI.I'll see you in the next lecture.Until then, bye, bye.Thank you.
