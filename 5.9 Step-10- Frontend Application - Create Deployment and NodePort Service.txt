# 5.9 Step-10- Frontend Application - Create Deployment and NodePort Service

-: Welcome back.In this lecture, we are going to create thefront end deployment and the front end node port service.So let's go ahead and then complete that now.So let's go to our queue based definition, copy it,and go to our front end deployment and paste it.So now we are going to create the kindes deploymentand it's function is going to be app/V1.So now in metadata,there are two things which we need to focus.One is name and the second is labels.So name is going to befront end and NGINX app, right?It is going to be a front end app, right?So and in labels we are going to say app is equal to same.We can try and then put the same front endNGINX app, okay?And tier, we'll say, front end.Good.So now we have completed the core section hereand now we'll focus on this specification section, okay?So as usual, we know that for deploymentwe'll have replicas, selectorand template are the three high level objectsunder the spec.Okay?So now replicas will give threeand in selector we'll have the match labels.And under match labels we'll provide the label asapp is equal to front end NGINX app.This is the same match label we need to providewhenever we are creating the port specification here, right?So and now under the templatewe are going to create the port specificationand port specification will have something calledmetadata and then spec.Two things under that.The (inaudible) under templater, metadataand then spec, right?So now in metadata, as usual we can have name.So ideally whatever the name we give for the pod hereit is going to take or take the referencefrom the deployment name.So ideally we really don't need to give name here.So we'll focus on labels and we'll have two labels here.One is app and the other is tier.And tier is going to be front endand app is going to be front end NGINX app.Good.So now the next thing is going to bespecification of our container, right?So containers, we are going to have containersas a list of things.And under that we are going to have a containerand then image name, okay?So let's go ahead and then define those things, okay?And we'll also have something called portsand I am going to say container port is going to be 80and name of my container is going to befront end NGINX app and the image,I'm going to bring that from my GitHub repo.My docker hub repo. Okay?So let me go to my stacks simplify here.Right?So where is this?Yeah, repositories.And let's go to Kube front end NGINX, okay?So this will have the my backend service as the proxy.Okay?So let me copy this still here and I'll paste it.:1.0.0, right?So this completes the deployment creationand now we'll go aheadand then create the front end node port service.So as you shall go aheadand then copy the base definition here.So let's define the service.Kindes is service and the version is B1and metadata will have name and then labelsand in name we'll say front endNGINX appoutput service and labels.I'll define it asfront end NGINX app.Okay?So let me remove this and tier.I'm going to say this is a front end tier, right?Front end, okay?And now, in specificationswe'll have three things here.Okay?Type, selectorand then ports.Okay?So type, we are going to define it as an output service,that is good,and selector, which is nothingbut to which part it needs to send that traffic tofrom the service.So we'll go to hereand then find the part specific label here.App is equal- sometimes we do that typo.So always goand then get from that respective port template, okay?So it is always good to do that way, okay?And then in ports we'll have http ports hereand I'll say port is nothingbut plus drive service port and target container portwhich is going to be 80 and north port.So till now our demos 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3over and we'll use 3, 1, 2, 3, 4 for us.Okay?If you don't define I'll automaticallycluster will providethat dynamic IP here in that respective range.Okay?So we are going to define it 3, 1, 2, 3, 4.So this completes the creation of service two.So let's go back to our command lineand then create those things.Okay?KubeCTR here apply hyphen Fand zero three and then hyphen F zero three is deploymentand zero four is front end north port service.So let's see if it creates and if not any issues.Okay?So it created that deployment Kubectl get portsso we'll see what are the ports it's going to create.So it's created three front end ports, no issues.Okay, so I'll say Kubectl, get svcand our front end engineers app node portservice also open running.So now we need to get ournodes public IP and then access it in browser.Copy any of the nodes, public IP hereso I can copy this one, this one, whatever it is, right?So I'll copy this and go to the browserand I'll create it.So let me close this talker hub.So we have 1, 2, 3.Now we are going to create one moreand then I'm going to say 3, 1, 2, 3, 4.And the context of my hello world application is helloand I got the output.So now let's clear here.Kubectl get ports right?And you can see that backend rest app.And then this is the the port idea, right?So we are getting 56 4 xn, okay?So how the load balancing is happeningwe can even continuously refresh and then see that, okay?So see 4 DCNS, okay?So one more time if we refresh, it might go 56 4 xn.So it is load balancing across all the parts.As soon as we refresh we are getting different IDs hereright?So that's about it.So we have successfully completed creating our backendand front end applications using Kubemanifests hereand then deployed and then tested end to end.Okay?So in our next lecture we are going to learn little bitabout recreating the objects using Kubectl applyand then understand better about it.I'll see you in the next lecture.Until then, bye bye.Thank you.
