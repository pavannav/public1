# 22.1 Step-00- Introduction to AWS NLB 6 Demos

-: Welcome back.As part of this section,we are going to create AWS network load balancersusing Kubernetes serviceon EKS cluster.So earlier, as part of Ingress,when we are learning with application load balancerALB Ingress,we already installed the AWS load balancer controller.The same load balancer controllerwill be able to also create the AWS network load balancerwhenever we use the Kubernetes object of type service.So using that, we are going to create six demosand understand AWS network load balancerusing Kubernetes service, which meanswe are going to declaratively write the configurationin Kubernetes k8s yaml manifestand create the AWS network load balancer-related use cases.So to start with, we are going to do, in the Demo 1,we are going to understand and implement NLB basics,which means all the important annotationsrelated to NLB basics, we are going to write itand understand them from the Kubernetes service perspective.And then we'll move on to the next demo,which is NLB TLS SSL,which means we are going to implement SSLfor our network load balancer from Kubernetes service.From there, we'll move onand also implement the NLBand then external DNS.So, how we have implemented the external DNS use casein application load balancer?Same way, we will also update the annotationsrelated to external DNS in Kubernetes serviceand ensure that NLB DNS also successfully registersusing external DNS in Route 53.And we'll also implement NLBand then elastic IP as Demo 4.And as part of Demo 5,we'll also implement internal network load balancer.And we are also going to test that with the curl pod.And as part of Demo 6,we'll also implement network load balancersending the traffic to the portsrunning on the Fargate infrastructure,which is a serverless infrastructure from AWS perspective.So all these demos we are going to implement step by step.So I'll see you in the next lecture.Until then, bye-bye. Thank you.
