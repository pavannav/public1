# 20.1 Step-01- Introduction to Ingress Internal ALB

-: Welcome back.In this section we are going to create the internalapplication load balancer using Kubernetes ingress manifest.To do so, we are going to use the scheme,scheme annotation as internal.So if you remember, sofor the internet facing related load balancer to createwe have provided the scheme as internet facing.So now we will comment that partand add the scheme as internal sothat it'll create the ingress ALB internal load balancerand to test this internal load balancer.Right?So we cannot connect to internal LBdirectly from internet two test it.So to do that we will deploy a curl part in EKScluster so we can connect to curl POD in EKS clusterand test the internal LB endpoint using the curl command.And these are the series of commands we aregoing to use for curl testing.So first we will deploy the curl part and usingthe cube CTL exit commandwe will connect to that respective curl part.And from curl part we'll be able to run the curl commands.So we'll run the curl command for our defaultbackend related use case and also for app onecurl test and also app two curl test.We are going to run it in the next lecture.We are going to practically implement this and test it.So I'll see you in the next lecture.Until then, bye bye.Thank you.
