# 11.1 EKS-08-00-LBC-01-What-are-we-going-to-learn-AWS-LBC-Ingress

Instructor: Welcome back!As part of AWS EKS load balancer controller, KubernetesIngress, Application Load Balancer, and also external DNS.So considering all these four things,we are going to implement 14 demos.If you see here, as part of demo one,we are going to install the AWS load balancer controller.And after that, we will learn the Ingress basicsas part of demo two.And later, we will implement the Ingress contextpart based routing as part of demo three.And later, we will implement the Ingress SSLand Ingress SSL redirect as part of demo fourand demo five.So considering all these demos will be relatedto application load balancer,which means every demo whatever we are creatingwe are going to implement these things usingKubernetes manifest on AWS application load balancer.And we are also going to install external DNSusing demo six.And later we will implement Ingress plus external DNSand Kubernetes service plus external DNSas part of demo seven and demo eight.Ingress plus external DNS in the sense,so whenever we deploy our Ingress manifest,automatically, the DNS registration happensin the AWS route 53 whatever the DNS namesdefined in the Ingress manifest.So that we are going to learn as part of demo seven.And as part of demo eight,not only with Ingress with regular Kubernetes service,which is of type load balancer, our note port services.So they also Ingress external DNS related annotations becan be added to DNS restart those service related DNS namesinside the route 53.So which means the Kubernetes serviceinside that you can add the external DNS annotationfor your application andthat DNS name using external DNS can be DNS restartin AWS route 53.So both demos, Ingress plus external DNSand Kubernetes serviceplus external DNS we are going to implement.After that we are also going to implement Ingressname based virtual host routing.So we already implemented Ingress context part base routing,so which is nothing but when the request comes toslash app one, go to app one whenever the request comes toslash app two, go to app two related backend.So those are context path based routing's.So name based virtual host routing is nothing but,whenever you access your application with app one dotsome domain.com, go to that respect to app onerelated backends.And when you access with app two dot some domain.com,the request should go to app two.So even that example we are going to implement usingKubernetes Ingress manifest and equivalent ALB ruleswill be created.And after that we are also going toimplement SSL discovery host and SSL discovery DLS.So without hard coding the AWS certificate manager,certificate ARN in your Ingress,so you can use the optionslike SSL discovery host and SSL discovery DLS.So those things also we are going to learnin detail with practical demos.And after that, we are going to implement Ingress groups.So with Ingress groups the large configurationof Kubernetes Ingress manifest can be split into small,small Kubernetes manifestand we can create multiple Ingress resourcesand combine them to a single group with a priority order.So we are going to learnthat in detail as part of demo two.And after that, we are also going to learnabout Ingress target types,which is instance mode and then IP mode.So far, whatever the demos we have implemented isdefault is going to be instance modeand we implemented it with instance mode.So here as part of demo 13, we are going to learnabout IP mode and implement that with IP mode.And finally, we are also going to implementthe Ingress internal ALB.And to test that, we are also going to deploy a cold portand connect to cold port and test it.So let's go aheadand then practically implement all these things now.So I'll see you in the next lecture.Until then, bye-bye.Thank you.
