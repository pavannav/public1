# 24.5 Step-05- Build Stage- AWS CodeBuild Introduction

-: Welcome back.In this lecture,we are going to understand about CodeBuildon a very high level.What is this CodeBuild serviceand then how we are going to use it, right?So CodeBuild is a fully managed build service in the cloud.So it compiles of a source code, runs the unit testsand then produces artifacts that are ready to deploy.So it eliminates the need to provision,manage and then scale our own build servers.So it provides prepackaged build environmentsfor the most two popular programming languagesand build tools such as Apache, MATLAB and Javaand then many more.So we can also customize build environmentsin CodeBuild to use our own build tools.So it scales automatically to meet the peak build requests.So if you see here how to run the CodeBuild, right?So if you want to run CodeBuild manually,you can run it from management consoleor you can run it from CLIor from SD Case or CodePipeline.So for in our case we are goingto run AWS CodeBuild using CodePipeline.So that's what we are going to do.So how CodeBuild works?So let's see that now.So if you are using the CodePipeline,what happens on the overall story,we are going to see that now.So as a developer, you are going to check in the codeto your respective source code repository, right?So what happens is like,once the change is triggered inside the source code,the CodePipeline will know that,and then it will regard the pipeline operation.So immediately, CodeBuild will triggerand then take the latest source code versionfrom our source code called commit repository,our GitHub repository or whatever is configuredas source code repository.So from there and then we'll start the build process.So during the build process,so based on if build is failed,if you want to send the notifications, right?So it can send the notificationusing Amazon notification service,simple notification service, right?So, and it also locks all the build locksinside the CloudWatch during that process.So in addition to that, it will have a build environmentwhich is a purely a Docker container environment.Or we can configure our own,we can build our own docker image and then use thatas our build environment, whatever we need.Okay so we have options to use manager docker imagesfor build environments,or custom build docker images also we can use here.So once the build is completed, right?So build logs are stored here and then notificationsare sent via SMS.So once the build is completed,it is going to store the artifacts inside the S3 buckets.So our focus here is like,we are not going to regard this build,the CodeBuild using not CLI or not management consoleor not Aztech.We are going to do it with CodePipeline.So we have seen the entire CodePipelineon a high level flow,how CodeBuild works in combination with CodePipeline.So the next thing is the architecture,so the CodeBuild architecture,we are going to see on a very high level.So this is the build environment,so which we will have the manager imagesand then our custom images,we can push it too easy to container registryor our images can be present in our dock hub,but those images we can use to useas our build environment inside the CodeBuild.So that is a very, very good feature, right?So if you have a already existing build processin our organizations and then if you want to integratewith CodeBuild, then get that respective containeror your manual build process convertedinto your own container and then bring it hereand then start using it under CodeBuild.So now, so this is the build environment.The next thing is the source, right?So CodeBuild supports its own,means like cloud related AWS related code commit service.So in addition to thatit also supports source as simple storage servicewhich is S3 and also it supports GitHub,GitHub enterprise and even also the build bucket.So the build artifacts, once the build is completedit is going to store in the S3 buckets.In addition to that build logs are storedin CloudWatch and build notificationsare sent using simple notifications.So what our CodeBuild steps on a very high level, right?So as a developer I check in the codeto local get report and then pushthe same code to code commit.And so from CodeBuild if you want to run the build manuallyso then you can reference that respect to codecommit version, whatever, whatever the source versionand then run your build,and then it automatically stores the artifactsin the simple storage service which is S3.So now what we are going to do in our next step isso we are going to review the build spec dot AMLand then CodeBuild environmental variables.So for this entire build process to happenthere will be one important artifact which it needs,how my CodeBuild process need to be defined,how my build process need to be defined,what should happen pre-build, means likebefore build, or pre-build, what should happenand before build also what commands it need to run.And then during the build what commands it needsto run, post build what commands it need to run.So all those processes will be definedinside a file called build spec dot yaml.So we are going to understand about that build spec dot yamland in our use case in relation with the DevOpswhat are those environmental variables,we are going to pass,all those things we are going to discuss now.So I'll see you in the next lecture.Until then, bye bye.Thank you.
